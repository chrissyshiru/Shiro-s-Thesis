@article{Valikangas2011a,
abstract = {This paper assesses the recent contribution of Michel Foucault to the study of power and subject in organizations. First, we theoretically examine Foucault's thinking by dividing his works into archaeological, genealogical and aesthetic/ethical phases. We then conduct a review of 113 inter- national journal articles from between the years 2000 and 2009. We do this in order to obtain an overview of the phases of Foucault's thinking that are prevalent in recent organization studies. We find that recent academic studies drawing on Foucault are increasingly leaning towards Foucault's writings on governmentality, as well as on his genealogical works, which have sustained their popu- larity. Reflecting the growing interest in governmentality and genealogy, we end by pointing out some avenues for future research.},

@article{Kaplan2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ongoing policy debate about the value of communications technology in promoting development objectives is diverse. Some view computer/web/phone communications technology as insufficient to solve development problems while others view communications technology as assisting all sections of the population. This paper looks at evidence to support or refute the idea that fixed and mobile telephones is, or could be, an effective healthcare intervention in developing countries. METHODS: A Web-based and library database search was undertaken including the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, (nursing {\&} allied health), Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), POPLINE, BIOSIS, and Web of Science, AIDSearch (MEDLINE AIDS/HIV Subset, AIDSTRIALS {\&} AIDSDRUGS) databases. RESULTS: Evidence can be found to both support and refute the proposition that fixed and mobile telephones is, or could be, an effective healthcare intervention in developing countries. It is difficult to generalize because of the different outcome measurements and the small number of controlled studies. There is almost no literature on using mobile telephones as a healthcare intervention for HIV, TB, malaria, and chronic conditions in developing countries. Clinical outcomes are rarely measured. Convincing evidence regarding the overall cost-effectiveness of mobile phone " telemedicine" is still limited and good-quality studies are rare. Evidence of the cost effectiveness of such interventions to improve adherence to medicines is also quite weak. CONCLUSION: The developed world model of personal ownership of a phone may not be appropriate to the developing world in which shared mobile telephone use is important. Sharing may be a serious drawback to use of mobile telephones as a healthcare intervention in terms of stigma and privacy, but its magnitude is unknown. One advantage, however, of telephones with respect to adherence to medicine in chronic care models is its ability to create a multi-way interaction between patient and provider(s) and thus facilitate the dynamic nature of this relationship. Regulatory reforms required for proper operation of basic and value-added telecommunications services are a priority if mobile telecommunications are to be used for healthcare initiatives.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is about more than having multiple computers in our environment; it is also about computers venturing into completely new environments. In this paper, we examine the impact of computers in the developing world and look at why most interventions to date have failed to address the key needs of the users and their context. Through an analysis of existing software design techniques, and various case studies, we propose a new model for software creation, which we believe will address the issue of creating technologies for developing world nations.},

abstract = {Mobile phones are a crucial mode of communication and welfare enhancement in poor countries, especially those lacking an infrastructure of fixed lines. In recent years much has been written about how mobile telephony in Africa is rapidly reducing the digital divide with developed countries. Yet, when one examines the evidence it is not at all clear what is really happening. In one country, Tanzania, for example, some observers point to the fact that 97{\%} of the population lives under the mobile footprint, while others show that ownership is very limited. These extreme values prompted us to review the situation in Africa as a whole, in an effort to discover what is really going on.},

Inquiry is based on three principles: 1. Data gathering must take place in the context of the users' work. 2. The data.gatherer and the user form a partnership to explore issues together. 3. The inquiry is based on a focus; that is, the inquiry is based on a clearly defined set of concerns, rather than on a list of specific questions (as in a survey). This article includes a description of Contextual Inquiry as we have used it at Digital Equipment Corporation and examples from our experiences as technical communicators and usability engineers on various projects that have used this method..},

Due to increasingly short product realization cycles, there has been growing interestth in more time efficient methods, including rapid prototyping methods and various usability inspection techniques. This paper will introduce "rapid ethnography," which is a collection of field methods intended to provide a reasonable understanding of users and their activities given significant time pressures and limited time in the field.. The core elements include limiting or constraining the research focus and scope, using key informants, capturing rich field data by using multiple observers and interactive observation techniques, and collaborative qualitative data analysis. A short case study illustrating the important characteristics of rapid ethnography will also be presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The aim of this article was to address questions on how parents use the internet to find information and support regarding children, health and family life. Another aim was to find out how professionals use the internet to provide support and information to parents. This was done by a literature review.METHODS:Articles were searched for in five databases with a search strategy called "building block" approach.RESULTS:The review showed that the majority of today's parents search for both information and social support on the internet. However, there are considerable differences due to gender, age and socio-economic differences. First time middle class mothers aged 30-35 are most active in looking up health and parent information on the internet. In the same time, several studies report diminishing class differences on parent web sites. An important reason to the increasing number of parents who turn to the internet for information and interaction has shown to be the weakened support many of today's parents experience from their own parents, relatives and friends. Professionals have recognized the parents' great interest for going online and offer both information and support on the net.CONCLUSION:Many benefits are reported, for example the possibility to reach out to a wider audience and to increase access to organisations without an increase in costs. Other benefits include the possibility for parents to remain anonymous in their contacts with professionals and that parents' perceived need for information can be effectively met around the clock. Interventions for wider groups of parents, such as parent training on the net, are still very rare and more research is needed to evaluate different types of interventions on the net. However, most studies were empirical and lacked theoretical frameworks which leave questions on how we can more fully understand this phenomenon unanswered.},

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between preterm birth, parental stress and negative feelings, and the environmental setting of NICU. 21 mothers (age = 36.00 ? 6.85) and 19 fathers (age = 34.92 ? 4.58) of preterm infants (GA = 30.96 ? 2.97) and 20 mothers (age = 40.08 ? 4.76) and 20 fathers (age = 40.32 ? 6.77) of full-term infants (GA = 39.19 ? 1.42) were involved. All parents filled out the Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the Impact of Event Scale Revised, Profile of Mood States, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the Post-Partum Bonding Questionnaire. Our data showed differences in emotional reactions between preterm and full-term parents. Results also revealed significant differences between mothers and fathers? responses to preterm birth in terms of stress, negative feelings, and perceptions of social support. A correlation between negative conditions at birth (e.g., birth weight and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay) and higher scores in some scales of Impact of Event Scale Revised, Profile of Mood States and Post-Partum Bonding Questionnaire were found. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit may be a stressful place both for mothers and fathers. It might be useful to plan, as soon as possible, interventions to help parents through the experience of the premature birth of their child and to begin an immediately adaptive mode of care.},

abstract = {We examine the growth of mobile phone technology over the past decade and consider its potential impacts upon quality of life in low-income countries, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. We first provide an overview of the patterns and determinants of mobile phone coverage in sub-Saharan Africa before describing the characteristics of primary and secondary mobile phone adopters on the continent. We then discuss the channels through which mobile phone technology can impact development outcomes, both as a positive externality of the communication sector and as part of mobile phone-based development projects, and analyze existing evidence. While current research suggests that mobile phone coverage and adoption have had positive impacts on agricultural and labor market efficiency and welfare in certain countries, empirical evidence is still somewhat limited. In addition, mobile phone technology cannot serve as the “silver bullet” for development in sub-Saharan Africa. Careful impact evaluations of mobile phone development projects are required to better understand their impacts upon economic and social outcomes, and mobile phone technology must work in partnership with other public good provision and investment},

@article{Dewsbury2004,
abstract = {This paper documents work from the EPSRC ‘EQUATOR' and Depend- ability Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration on Computer Based Systems (DIRC) concerned with the appropriate design of dependable assistive technology to enable older and disabled people to maintain a quality of life within their own homes. Technology, especially so-called ‘smart home' technology, can only be used to assist people if it is effectively designed. Designers are therefore required to consider certain key questions such as what situation they are designing for, what solutions should do, and who should use them. The focus in this paper is on understanding and identifying user needs and system requirements for dependability in the complex challenge of inclusive design. The feature of inclusive design addressed here is the new emphasis on the user, a living, breathing person situated in real world settings along with others, rather than some designer's abstraction. The acceptance or rejection of assistive technology relies on the users' perceptions of the designed technology as well as the appropriateness of the technology designed. Consequently, this paper suggests that despite highly imaginative views of future technologies, getting such dreams to work generally means they must, at some point, meet the real world and engage with the needs of users if they are to be sufficiently grounded. Given this emphasis on users, the highly personal character of domestic settings presents conventional research techniques with obdurate problems that can make research practically and ethically difficult. Researching domestic spaces and domestic values requires different methods to understand the unique needs and experiences of residents. Accordingly, the authors report on their experiences of using observational studies and adapting ‘cultural probes' to foster an ongoing dialogue with the members of their user groups, to gain insights into their needs and generate design relevant information and inspiration. The paper discusses how such information might feed into dependable design through consideration of a model of dependability. KEY},

abstract = {Abstract Activity theory -- a conceptual framework originally developed by Aleksei Leontiev -- has its roots in the socio-cultural tradition in Russian psychology. The foundational concept of the theory is human activity, which is understood as purposeful, mediated, and transformative interaction between human beings and the world. Since the early 1990s, activity theory has been a visible landmark in the theoretical landscape of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Along with some other frameworks, such as distributed cognition and phenomenology, it established itself as a leading post-cognitivist approach in HCI and interaction design. In this book we discuss the conceptual foundations of activity theory and its contribution to HCI research. After making the case for theory in HCI and briefly discussing the contribution of activity theory to the field (Chapter One) we introduce the historical roots, main ideas, and principles of activity theory (Chapter Two). After that we present in-depth analyses of three...},

While children's palliative care nurses encounter many of the stressors in common with other nurses, this unique context of care generates specific aspects of stress that warrant further examination. This qualitative study explores the experiences of stress in nurses providing children's palliative care in one region of the UK. In total, four focus groups took place with children's hospice nurses, community children's nurses and children's nurse specialists based in the regional children's hospital. The focus groups were taped, transcribed and analysed through the application of Newell and Burnard's thematic content analysis methodology. Four core themes emerged: work demands; relationships, maintaining control, and support and roles. Of particular note were stressors associated with the sub-themes of relationships, emotional demands and ethical conflicts. Conclusions illustrating how individuals and organizations may reduce the impact of stress in nurses contributing to the palliative care of children and their families are made.},

The findings revealed that the family members experience negative feelings, characterized by sadness, pain, anger, depression, and frustration, as they care for their loved one within the context of extreme poverty. Quality care was compromised in situations where basic resources were not available. Guidelines to assist families in caring for their loved one with HIV/AIDS at home were developed.},

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.},

Rather than relying on occasional in-clinic interactions, mobile health (mHealth) interventions may overcome constraints due to limited clinician time, poor patient adherence, and inability to provide meaningful interventions at the most appropriate time. Technological capability, however, does not equate with user acceptance and adoption. How then can we ensure that mobile technologies for behavior change meet the needs of their target audience? In this paper, we argue that overcoming acceptance and adoption barriers requires interdisciplinary collaborations, bringing together not only technologists and health researchers but also human-computer interaction (HCI) experts. We discuss the value of human-computer interaction research to the nascent field of mHealth and demonstrate how research from HCI can offer complementary insights on the creation of mobile health interventions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations in mobile health and suggest ways to overcome them.},

By describing the strategies used for the design of the activities, we will suggest possible approaches aimed toward widening the space for contributions of children and including them at a more creative level. Within that, major emphasis will be dedicated to discussing the “empowering dimension” of participatory design activities as an instrument to enhance benefits both for design results and for the children themselves.

In contrast, we are proposing a cooperative prototyping approach where users are involved actively and creatively in design and evaluation of early developed prototypes. This paper will present a detailed analysis of an example of application of the approach-design of computer support for casework in a technical department of a local government, where urban planning and environmental control of companies are central work tasks. The analysis starts out from the mutual object of design: the work processes of the prospective users. We look at design as a learning process and analyze various situations where openings for learning occur in the prototyping activity. These situations seem to fall into three categories: the first is situations where the future work situation is simulated and the conditions of the future work activity investigated, in particular the role of the computer application. The second is where the prototype is used as a basis for discussion and articulation of problems with the current work practice, and goals of the future one. The third kind of situations are situations where the design situation as such becomes the focus. Based on the example and earlier results we discuss benefits, problems and prospects of the approach. In particular we discuss the tension between needs for careful preparation of prototyping sessions and establishing good conditions for user and designer creativity. The message with this respect is that users and designers should learn from breakdowns and focus shifts in the prototyping sessions rather than trying to avoid them.},

abstract = {Our society is increasingly influenced by modern information and communication technology (ICT). Health care has profited greatly by this development. How could health care provision look in the near future, in 10 years, or more precisely, in the year 2013? What measures must be undertaken by political and self-governing health institutions, and by medical informatics research, to ensure an efficient, medically advanced and yet affordable future health care system? Three factors will greatly influence the further development of information processing in health care within the near future: the development of the population, medical advances, and advances in informatics. These factors have motivated us to set up 30 theses for health care provision in the year 2013. The theses cover areas of health care, such as its people, its information systems, and its ICT tools. Three major goals requiring achievement have been identified: patient-centered recording and use of medical data for cooperative care, process-integrated decision support through current medical knowledge, comprehensive use of patient data for research and health care reporting. In consequence, political institutions should provide a framework for networked, patient-centered health care. They are called on to regulate the storage and exchange of health care data and of appropriate information system architectures. Finally, the health care institutions themselves must emphasize professional information management more strongly. Relevant research topics in medical informatics are: comprehensive electronic patient records, modern health information system architectures, architectures for medical knowledge centers, specific data processing methods ('medical data mining'), and multi-functional, mobile ICT tools.},

abstract = {This is the second of five papers in the child survival series. The first focused on continuing high rates of child mortality (over 10 million each year) from preventable causes: diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, HIV/AIDS, the underlying cause of undernutrition, and a small group of causes leading to neonatal deaths. We review child survival interventions feasible for delivery at high coverage in low-income settings, and classify these as level 1 (sufficient evidence of effect), level 2 (limited evidence), or level 3 (inadequate evidence). Our results show that at least one level-1 intervention is available for preventing or treating each main cause of death among children younger than 5 years, apart from birth asphyxia, for which a level-2 intervention is available. There is also limited evidence for several other interventions. However, global coverage for most interventions is below 50{\%}. If level 1 or 2 interventions were universally available, 63{\%} of child deaths could be prevented. These findings show that the interventions needed to achieve the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds by 2015 are available, but that they are not being delivered to the mothers and children who need them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern healthcare is burgeoning with patient centered rhetoric where physicians "share power" equally in their interactions with patients. However, how physicians actually conceptualize and manage their power when interacting with patients remains unexamined in the literature. This study explored how power is perceived and exerted in the physician-patient encounter from the perspective of experienced physicians. It is necessary to examine physicians' awareness of power in the context of modern healthcare that espouses values of dialogic, egalitarian, patient centered care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Thirty physicians with a minimum five years' experience practicing medicine in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Family Medicine were recruited. The authors analyzed semi-structured interview data using LeCompte and Schensul's three stage process: Item analysis, Pattern analysis, and Structural analysis. Theoretical notions from Bourdieu's social theory served as analytic tools for achieving an understanding of physicians' perceptions of power in their interactions with patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The analysis of data highlighted a range of descriptions and interpretations of relational power. Physicians' responses fell under three broad categories: (1) Perceptions of holding and managing power, (2) Perceptions of power as waning, and (3) Perceptions of power as non-existent or irrelevant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although the "sharing of power" is an overarching goal of modern patient-centered healthcare, this study highlights how this concept does not fully capture the complex ways experienced physicians perceive, invoke, and redress power in the clinical encounter. Based on the insights, the authors suggest that physicians learn to enact ethical patient-centered therapeutic communication through reflective, effective, and professional use of power in clinical encounters.},

Some of the earliest work on fairness in algorithm design defined fairness as a guarantee of similar outputs for "similar" input data, a notion with tight technical connections to differential privacy. We study whether tensions exist between differential privacy and statistical notions of fairness, namely Equality of False Positives and Equality of False Negatives (EFP/EFN). We show that even under full distributional access, there are cases where the constraint of differential privacy precludes exact EFP/EFN. We then turn to ask whether one can learn a differentially private classifier which approximately satisfies EFP/EFN, and show the existence of a PAC learner which is private and approximately fair with high probability. We conclude by giving an efficient algorithm for classification that maintains utility and satisfies both privacy and approximate fairness with high probability.},

abstract = {Underdeveloped and developing regions are among the most important arenas for social design and increasingly attract broader interest from other fields of research and practice. Participatory design and co-creation are typical approaches to collecting indigenous wisdom and creating design solutions with social empathy and inclusion. However, the unequal involvement of local participants and inherent knowledge barriers evident in collaborations frequently lead to problems in the suitability and sustainability of systems built in the design process. Strategies and methods for engaging local communities more deeply in co-creation are needed to address these issues. Following transdisciplinary empirical studies in real-world rural Chinese settings, we explored the novel use of interactive drama to engage a local community in short-term cross-cultural co-creation with the goal of building the core characteristics of a local but better community. The results from the participatory process and participants' feedback are promising, with clear indicators of community engagement and knowledge sharing beyond the design process itself. The lessons learnt and approaches discussed in this paper provide a starting point for increasing community engagement with social design practices and research across different societies.},

The notion of ‘designing for participation' is advanced as a quintessential perspective for approaches in which design practices are re-configured from a community-centric standpoint. Building on insights from PD and community development studies, as well as on empirical evidence from two community design studies, we argue that designing for participation appears to be located in a space between the designer's and local views of participation, which are at times both ambiguous and conflicting. To overcome these tensions, we argue for the importance of engaging critically and reflectively with PD in community contexts, and in this process capitalising on disciplinary dialogues that can expand the viewpoint from which PD projects are negotiated and evaluated.},

abstract = {A scenario-based role-playing experiment is well suited for research seeking to understand how and why operations and supply chain managers, when dealing with complex issues, form their judgments and preferences or make the decisions that they do. As a method for data collection, a scenario-based role-playing experiment deploys varying versions of a descriptive vignette to convey scripted information about specific levels of factors of interest that are hypothesized, upfront, to influence judgments, preferences or decisions. Human subjects are recruited to assume an a priori defined role and, in this role, to then form their judgments and preferences or make their decisions in response to the scripted information conveyed in at least one version of the vignette. For these judgments, preferences or decisions to be useful for subsequent statistical analyses, the vignette and its varying versions to be deployed in a scenario-based role-playing experiment must be appropriately designed (i.e., written and presented) and validated. This commentary speaks to this "vignette design and validation" issue and prescribes a three-stage process to create a vignette with its derivative versions that is clear, realistic, complete (in that it contains all information necessary for human subjects to assume their role and to consequently provide their reactions and responses), and is effective (in that it cues human subjects to perceive the desired levels of the factors of interest). {\textcopyright} 2011 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.},

Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative content analysis was undertaken, based on categories derived from Bellamy's models, focusing on four different democracy models: consumer; demo-elitist; neo-republican; and cyber-democratic. Findings - The results indicated that the demo-elitist model was reflected mainly by the contributions of politicians, while the neo-republican model was reflected by those of citizens. Note that repeating genres in the discourse were revealed by the qualitative analysis and these tended to take the form of patterns in the communication form and reflected the conflict of interest between citizens and politicians. Concludes that, while insights into the nature of the discourse are supported by the Web site, there is still little known about the possible ways of translating this kind of knowledge into better Web site design.

abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are widely acknowledged as important resources for socio‐ economic development. Due to resource constraints, shared access forms the dominant mode of access to these technologies in most developing countries. Governments, non‐governmental institutions and business entrepreneurs have invested significant amounts of human and financial resources in public libraries, telecenters, internet caf{\'{e}}s and other forms of public access, without clear evidence on what the ultimate outcomes will be and the actual costs. This report presents a review of empirical research on the impacts of public access to ICTs in order to document what is known about this approach to ICT service delivery. The results show that there is limited conclusive evidence on downstream impacts of public access to ICTs. The evidence that does exist suggests that the public access ICT model is not living up to the expectations placed on it. This is not necessarily because public access has had no impacts, but because its impact is particularly difficult to identify and measure. As a model, public access to ICTs has experienced success and failure, leading to both reinforcement of the belief that the model should be expanded and strengthened; as well as claims that public access ICTs are ultimately ineffective or even counter‐productive from the development perspective. Four main types of evidence are identified – evidence on venue performance and sustainability, users, usage patterns and downstream impacts. Assessment of this evidence indicates that trends are most apparent in the first three areas, while evidence of downstream impacts remains elusive. Most studies show that sustainability is a critical challenge especially in low resource, low income environments where commercial services are not viable. They also show that users are primarily young males with relatively high socio‐economic status and prior access to the Internet. Users tend to engage in social and personal activities as opposed to economic activities, for example. Findings on downstream impacts fall on both sides of the equation – some studies conclude that impacts are high in a variety of areas – development of ICT skills, job creation, civic engagement etc; others find limited impacts.},

Parents think that they have lost control because of unfamiliar environment. Therefore, stress management is very important in this period. The family as the main factor of strength and protection for infant is required as the bases of standard care in NICU. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate stress management in Iranian NICU Parents. Methods: Using qualitative content analysis approach helped to collect and analysis data for open coding, classification, and theme abstraction. Twenty one parents with hospitalized neonates, physicians and nurses in the city of Isfahan were purposely recruited and selected for in-depth interviews. Results: The analyzed content revealed unique stress management approaches among the parents. The main themes were: 1) spirituality, 2) seeking information, 3) Seeking hope, 4) maintaining calm, 5) attachment to infant, and 6) communicating with the medical team Conclusion: Findings of this study highlights the importance of medical team's attention to stressed parents who are trying to make adjustment or adapt to the hospitalization of their infant. A revised management approach to address the emotional needs of parents of neonates in Iran seems essential for improving communication with physicians and nurses.},

abstract = {Background: Poor communication skills decrease job satisfaction, increase employee turnover, and decrease the quality of patient care (Donchin et al., 2003). Multiple studies have showed that communication training improves communication, conflict management, and overall job satisfaction (Boss et al, 2013; Jasper et al., 2011). A level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) had been dealing with communication issues that appeared to decrease job satisfaction and had lost experienced staff members to other institutions. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase effective interdisciplinary communication, improve conflict management, teamwork, leadership, and job satisfaction between the interdisciplinary staff within the NICU with a communication intervention. Methods: A pretest/posttest design measured the variables of communication, conflict management, teamwork, leadership, and overall job satisfaction of the interdisciplinary staff of a NCIU before and after a communication intervention. Results: A communication improvement initiative does significantly increase effective communication (P = .009) (P = .029) and conflict management (P = 0.31) among the interdisciplinary staff of a NICU. Implications for Practice: These findings support the use of communication improvement projects to not only improve communication of an interdisciplinary team, but also for conflict management. Implications for Research: Consideration for further studies includes the use of councils and shared governance within the framework of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The role of EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN A NICU 3 councils and their dynamics within this theory were efficient and beneficial to the outcomes of this project.},

abstract = {This second paper in the Born Too Soon supplement presents a review of the epidemiology of preterm birth, and its burden globally, including priorities for action to improve the data. Worldwide an estimated 11.1{\%} of all livebirths in 2010 were born preterm (14.9 million babies born before 37 weeks of gestation), with preterm birth rates increasing in most countries with reliable trend data. Direct complications of preterm birth account for one million deaths each year, and preterm birth is a risk factor in over 50{\%} of all neonatal deaths. In addition, preterm birth can result in a range of long-term complications in survivors, with the frequency and severity of adverse outcomes rising with decreasing gestational age and decreasing quality of care. The economic costs of preterm birth are large in terms of immediate neonatal intensive care, ongoing long-term complex health needs, as well as lost economic productivity. Preterm birth is a syndrome with a variety of causes and underlying factors usually divided into spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm births. Consistent recording of all pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirths, and standard application of preterm definitions is important in all settings to advance both the understanding and the monitoring of trends. Context specific innovative solutions to prevent preterm birth and hence reduce preterm birth rates all around the world are urgently needed. Strengthened data systems are required to adequately track trends in preterm birth rates and program effectiveness. These efforts must be coupled with action now to implement improved antenatal, obstetric and newborn care to increase survival and reduce disability amongst those born too soon.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how vulnerable consumers can be involved in transformative service design and how this approach may enhance the design of such services. The study also analyzes how co-design with vulnerable consumers differs from existing user involvement processes with the purpose of developing a co-design framework. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was employed, with six high schools in Australia identified as sites to conduct co-design sessions for a school-based alcohol education program. Adolescents were invited to review and (re)design an existing alcohol education program. Findings The study indicates that co-design with vulnerable consumers cannot be approached in the same way as conventional user involvement processes. Based on the insights generated from six co-design sessions as well as the examination of user involvement and co-design literature, the authors propose a six-step co-design framework. The six steps comprise resourcing, planning, recruiting, sensitizing, facilitation and evaluation. Research limitations/implications The co-design framework illustrates important differences to conventional user involvement processes. However, the generalizability of the research findings is limited to a specific study setting and a narrowly defined sample. Future research in a different setting is needed to further validate the presented findings. Practical implications For service design practice, this study provides guidelines on how co-design activities with vulnerable consumers can be effectively resourced, planned, recruited, sensitized, facilitated and evaluated. The framework outlines how co-design may be applied so that vulnerable consumers can become empowered participants during the design process. Originality/value This research contributes to the knowledge in transformative service research – a priority in service research – and service design by extending the boundaries of our understanding of processes and tools for the involvement of vulnerable consumers in transformative service design.},

@article{Seising2006,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This article delineates a relatively unknown path in the history of medical philosophy and medical diagnosis. It is concerned with the phenomenon of vagueness in the physician's "style of thinking" and with the use of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations with a view to create a model of such reasoning when physicians make a diagnosis. It represents specific features of medical ways of thinking that were mentioned by the Polish physician and philosopher Ludwik Fleck in 1926. The paper links Lotfi Zadeh's work on system theory before the age of fuzzy sets with system-theory concepts in medical philosophy that were introduced by the philosopher Mario Bunge, and with the fuzzy-theoretical analysis of the notions of health, illness, and disease by the Iranian-German physician and philosopher Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh. MATERIAL: Some proposals to apply fuzzy sets in medicine were based on a suggestion made by Zadeh: symptoms and diseases are fuzzy in nature and fuzzy sets are feasible to represent these entity classes of medical knowledge. Yet other attempts to use fuzzy sets in medicine were self-contained. The use of this approach contributed to medical decision-making and the development of computer-assisted diagnosis in medicine. CONCLUSION: With regard to medical philosophy, decision-making, and diagnosis; the framework of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations is very useful to deal with the absence of sharp boundaries of the sets of symptoms, diagnoses, and phenomena of diseases. The foundations of reasoning and computer assistance in medicine were the result of a rapid accumulation of data from medical research. This explosion of knowledge in medicine gave rise to the speculation that computers could be used for the medical diagnosis. Medicine became, to a certain extent, a quantitative science. In the second half of the 20th century medical knowledge started to be stored in computer systems. To assist physicians in medical decision-making and patient care, medical expert systems using the theory of fuzzy sets and relations (such as the Viennese "fuzzy version" of the Computer-Assisted Diagnostic System, CADIAG, which was developed at the end of the 1970s) were constructed. The development of fuzzy relations in medicine and their application in computer-assisted diagnosis show that this fuzzy approach is a framework to deal with the "fuzzy mode of thinking" in medicine.},

abstract = {Mothers need consistent, sustained information and support to develop and meet personal breastfeeding goals, but often receive insufficient assistance and conflicting and incorrect advice. The use of technology may be helpful in supplementing existing health care professional breastfeeding education and support efforts. We developed and evaluated a computer-based animated, interactive agent designed to provide breastfeeding information and support to mothers interested in breastfeeding. A randomized controlled study of a first-generation system was conducted to determine the feasibility of (1) use of the Computer Agent; (2) the recruitment plan; and (3) the planned outcome evaluation (assessing the impact of the intervention on intent to breastfeed, attitudes towards breastfeeding, and breastfeeding self-efficacy). The pilot study (N = 15) showed that the use of the Computer Agent, the recruitment plan, and the planned outcome evaluation were all feasible. Mothers who used the Computer Agent had greater intentions to exclusively breastfeed after exposure to the Agent (intent to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months 1-7 scale score of 6.14 (post) vs. 5.14 (pre); p {\textless} 0.05). Non-statistically significant trends in improvement with use of the Computer Agent breastfeeding support system were also seen in the between subjects analyses of intent to breastfeed and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of using a Computer Agent to support breastfeeding mothers and informed the design of a larger randomized clinical trial. An interactive Computer Agent may be helpful in improving rates of exclusive breastfeeding, particularly when there is not adequate health care professional support.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Premature delivery and prolonged hospitalization of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are very stressful for parents. As technology has advanced, short message services (SMS) have been used increasingly in the medical disciplines. To date, the use of SMS for updating patients and families regarding medical information has not been reported. We implemented the SMS technique to daily update the parents regarding the health status of their preterm infant. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of SMS technology and to assess its impact on the parents and the nursing staff. STUDY DESIGN Parents and nurses completed questionnaires at two time periods: pre-SMS implementation (pre-SMSi) and post-SMS implementation (post-SMSi). The parent questionnaires included statements about medical information delivery, communication and trust between parents and medical staff, parental anxiety and overall satisfaction. The nurse questionnaires included statements about the expected and actual impact on their workload. RESULTS Comparison of the parents' responses at the two time periods indicated that in the post-SMSi time period, they felt that the physician was more available when needed (P=0.002), they were more comfortable about approaching the physician (P=0.001) and more satisfied with the medical information provided by the staff (P=0.03). In the post-SMSi period, 78.1{\%} of the nurses noted that the SMS communication is a convenient and user-friendly method. CONCLUSIONS SMS updating is an easy and user-friendly technology that enriches the modalities of information delivery to parents of hospitalized preterm infants. It is a complementary and useful tool for encouraging and improving personal communication between parents and medical staff and should be considered part of quality improvement in health care.},

Wireless technology is altering the manner in which health care is delivered, the patient experience, and the cost of health care. 2 Mobile devices and mobile health (mHealth) services help with maternal care, chronic disease management, and disease epidemics. They improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical system through patient tracking and reporting, and they extend critically needed health services to underserved areas. The virtues of mobile are especially apparent in emerging countries. In many places around the world, there has been an explosion of mobile apps, remote monitoring devices, and online instructional materials. This has brought new information to health workers such as midwives who are on the frontlines of care and aiding rural populations who need medical treatment and advice. In this report, I examine mHealth applications in Africa.

abstract = {The effect of breastfeeding education on breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes of nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was evaluated. NICU nurses (intervention) and pediatric nurses (untreated control) working at a northeastern US children's hospital participated in the pretest/posttest design study. Both groups answered the same breastfeeding questionnaire on 2 occasions. NICU nurses completed the questionnaire the second time after attending the education session. Outcome measures evaluated by questionnaire items were (1) breastfeeding knowledge, (2) pro-breastfeeding attitudes, (3) baby-focused care attitudes, and (4) nurse-focused care attitudes. Comparison groups were similar at pretest on demographic variables and remained so despite attrition between pretesting and posttesting. A significant increase (P {\textless} .001) occurred in NICU nurses' breastfeeding knowledge after the education session. Findings suggest that an educational intervention has potential for improving NICU nurses' knowledge and certain attitudes about breastfeeding but may not alter other attitudes of interest in the desired direction.},

abstract = {Engaging young people in participatory design can be challenging, particularly in health-related projects. In a study co-designing diabetes support and information services with teenagers, we found framing activities using popular culture was a useful strategy. Various cultural references helped us stage activities that were productive for the design process, and were engaging for our young participants (e.g. exploring practical implications through discussions in a 'Dragons' Den'). Some activities were more effective than others and the idea of language-games, which has been widely explored in participatory design, explains why our strategy was successful when there was a clear 'family resemblance' between the popular cultural references and certain essential stages of designing. However, attention is required in selecting appropriate cultural references if this strategy is adopted elsewhere, and design facilitators should focus first on devising accessible language-games, rather than expecting popular cultural references to provide complete solutions to the challenge of staging participatory design. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Designers and design educators in many parts of the world are discussing a new framework for our discipline. This framework offers a new way of thinking about the diversity of design, encompassing the entire spectrum of work from craft to high-tech applications. The goal of this paper is to sketch the central features of this framework and discuss some of the implications for future development of the discipline in professional practice and in education. Design is rapidly maturing as a discipline. But along the path of consolidation and expansion are many tensions and uncertainties-the relation of design practice and design research, the relation of different branches of design, and the relation of different visions or philosophies of design. The idea of an "ecology of culture" offers a perspective on these tensions and a way to move forward with our collective enterprise of making design a central discipline of the next century. As I walked on the shore of Cape Town last night to the opening ceremonies of our conference, I saw through the rain and mist a small sliver of land in the bay. Naively, I asked my host if it was part of the peninsula that extends south of the city or an island. With what, in retrospect, must have been great patience, she quietly explained that it was not "an" island, it was "the" island. I was embarrassed, but I knew immediately what she meant. I spent the rest of the evening thinking about the political prisoners who were held on Robben Island, human rights, and the irony of a conference within sight of Table Bay that seeks to explore the reshaping of South Africa by design.},

abstract = {Although current levels of the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) are within reach of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 12 per 1 000 live births, the absolute number of deaths is unacceptably high for a lower-middle-income country such as South Africa (SA). Neonatal mortality over the last decade has declined very slowly, and is not commensurate with the level of government investment in healthcare. The recent neonatal mortality rate of 21 per 1 000 live births reported by the SA Demographic Health Survey is of major concern. This paper reviews recent efforts to reduce the neonatal mortality rate, including support for the implementation of neonatal policies and plans, and strengthening programmes to deliver low-cost, high-impact interventions. We review recent estimates of the NMR and causes of neonatal deaths, and discuss how the mortality from preventable causes of death could be reduced. If SA is to meet the SDG target, special attention should be given to the availability of high-impact interventions, providing an adequate number of appropriately trained healthcare providers and a more active role played by ward-based community health workers and district clinical specialist teams.},

abstract = {Objective: In response to high maternal mortality rates, the global community has rallied to improve the state of maternal health worldwide. However, progress towards the fifth Millennium Development Goal, "Improve Maternal Health," has been disappointingly slow. There is a pressing need to address the factors that contribute to maternal mortality, one of which is access to care. This health demand is particularly urgent in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where maternal mortality is disproportionately high compared with developed countries. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions rural women have about barriers to access to maternity care in Asembo Bay, Kenya. Methods: We conducted interviews with individuals and convened a focus group of lay women and care professionals. The results of the interviews and focus group were then analyzed thematically. Results: Common social themes that emerged related to women's access of maternity care in this population included fears associated with HIV testing or disclosure of HIV status, gender inequalities, and attitudes towards facility-based care. Conclusion: Data and themes in this study are consistent with previous research and provide a descriptive account of the barriers that prevent rural Kenyan mothers from accessing health care throughout their pregnancies. Each barrier explored here translates into an area of improvement where focus is needed to increase access to care and, ultimately, to reduce maternal mortality in this setting.},

@article{Coiera2006,
abstract = {The care of patients now almost inevitably seems to involve many different individuals, all needing to share patient information and discuss their management. As a consequence there is increasing interest in, and use of, information and communication technologies to support health services. Yet, while there is significant discussion of, and investment in, information technologies, communication systems receive much less attention and the clinical adoption of even simpler services like voice-mail or electronic mail is still not commonplace in many health services. There remain enormous gaps in our broad understanding of the role of communication services in health care delivery. Laboratory medicine is perhaps even more poorly studied than many other areas, such as the interface between primary care and hospital services. Given this lack of specific information about laboratory communication services, this paper will step back and generally review the components of a communication system, including the basic concepts of a communication channel, service, device and interaction mode. The review will then try and summarise some of what is known about specific communication problems that arise across health services in the main, including the community and hospital service delivery.},

Arguably without the search technology offered by online digital archives the lives of many individuals would have remained in obscurity. Furthermore, the level of detail that can be quickly gleaned about individuals from the past, particularly when multiple digital archives are accessed, raises ethical questions. For example, when reporting findings researchers could be disclosing personal information that is unknown to descendants, and if it relates to a sensitive topic then there is the potential for the researcher to cause distress. However, the rapid growth in digital archives has meant there has been little consideration of what ethical concerns digital archives might generate.

Through content analytic methods, three broad categories were revealed: descriptions of having a premature infant in the NICU, descriptions of parenting a premature infant, and the influence of Lumbee culture on parenting a premature infant. Certain aspects of American Indian culture appear to be important in having a premature infant in the NICU and in parenting a premature infant. We recommend that health care providers deliver culturally appropriate care that fully supports American Indian mothers and their premature infants.},

abstract = {Background: User involvement in the development of health care services is important for the viability, usability, and effectiveness of services. This study reports on the second step of the co-design process. Objective: The aim was to explore the significant challenges in advancing the co-design process during the requirements specification phase of a mobile Internet service for the self-management of physica activity (PA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A participatory action research design was used to involve lead users and stakeholders as co-designers. Lead users (n=5), a clinical physiotherapist (n=1), researchers (n=2) with knowledge in PA in RA and behavioral learning theories, an eHealth strategist (n=1), and an officer from the patient organization (n=1) collaborated in 4 workshops. Data-collection methods included video recordings and naturalistic observations. Results: The inductive qualitative video-based analysis resulted in 1 overarching theme, merging perspectives, and 2 subthemes reflecting different aspects of merging: (1) finding a common starting point and (2) deciding on design solutions. Seven categories illustrated the specific challenges: reaching shared understanding of goals, clarifying and handling the complexity of participants' roles, clarifying terminology related to system development, establishing the rationale for features, negotiating features, transforming ideas into concrete features, and participants' alignment with the agreed goal and task. Conclusions: Co-designing the system requirements of a mobile Internet service including multiple stakeholders was a complex and extensive collaborative decision-making process. Considering, valuing, counterbalancing, and integrating different perspectives into agreements and solutions (ie, the merging of participants' perspectives) were cmcial for moving the process forward and were considered the core challenges of co-design. Further research is needed to replicate the results and to increase knowledge on key factors for a successful co-design of health care services.},

That we were able to plan for our future and make decisions about what works for us (Family member, "Strengthening Services for Families" project, Evans, 2013). New methodologies for facilitating meaningful citizen engagement have become increasingly important in a world in which many of the responses to the critical public policy problems we face need to be co-created with citizens and stakeholders. This chapter focuses on the growing academic and practice-based interest in co-design and assesses its' contribution to social progress. It argues that co-design has an essential role to play in building trust with citizens and stakeholders, eliciting knowledge of policy and delivery problems that public organisations do not possess and monitoring and supporting the needs and aspirations of target groups over time. However, the success of co-design is all in the doing. Done badly it can destroy trust systems; done well it can help solve policy and delivery problems, stabilise turbulent lives, and improve life chances. The chapter aims to provide an understanding of the emergence and development of the co-design approach and associated methods, the principles underpinning it, and, the ingredients of better practice. It will draw on both academic and practice-based understanding. Both of the authors of this chapter have longstanding experience working on co-design interventions in both developed and developing contexts. Certain of these interventions will be used to illustrate both the strengths and the weaknesses of the approach.},

Second, this review indicates that design has not caught up with technology and that to create for diverse audiences the process must be deliberate.},

abstract = {Stigma and discrimination play significant roles in the development and maintenance of the HIV epidemic. It is well documented that people living with HIV and AIDS experience stigma and discrimination on an ongoing basis. This impact goes beyond individuals infected with HIV to reach broadly into society, both disrupting the functioning of communities and complicating prevention and treatment of HIV. This paper reviews the available scientific literature on HIV/AIDS and stigma in South Africa, as well as press reports on the same subject over a period of 3 years. Analysis of this material indicates that stigma drives HIV out of the public sight, so reducing the pressure for behaviour change. Stigma also introduces a desire not to know one's own status, thus delaying testing and accessing treatment. At an individual level stigma undermines the person's identity and capacity to cope with the disease. Fear of discrimination limits the possibility of disclosure even to potential important sources of support such as family and friends. Finally, stigma impacts on behaviour change as it limits the possibility of using certain safer sexual practices. Behaviour such as wanting to use condoms could be seen as a marker of HIV, leading to rejection and stigma. All interventions need to address stigma as part of their focus. However, the difficulty of the task should not be underestimated, as has been shown by the persistence of discrimination based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.},

Yet the question on how design of stakeholder dialogue and supporting methods actually enhance learning in stakeholder dialogue deserves more attention. This paper presents constructive conflict as a central design issue for stakeholder dialogue. This means that a dialogue entails the articulation of a diversity of perspectives and the confrontation of claims and ideas based on these perspectives. Building on three properties of diversity (variety, balance and disparity), the methodo- logical implications of constructive conflict as a central design issue will be derived. These implications are structured according to three design steps: stakeholder identification and selection, articulation of perspectives and confrontation of claims and ideas. It is argued that social scientific methods are needed to support design of stakeholder dialogue. Q methodology is presented as an example that was used in a stakeholder dialogue on sustainable biomass in the Netherlands to identify stakeholder perspectives, to select stakeholders and to structure the dialogue.

@article{Pade2009,
abstract = {Abstract Rural development can be enhanced and supported by information and communication technology (ICT), the use of which is highlighted by the emerging importance of information and knowledge as key strategic resources for social and economic development. The use of ICT presents a number of constraints which threaten the sustainability of rural ICT projects. Sustainability is key to the effec- tiveness of a rural ICT project. The categories of sustainability reveal critical suc- cess factors that need to be considered in the implementation and management of rural ICT projects. An exploration of the Dwesa project reveals the extent and effect of the application of these critical success factors of sustainability. 1 Introduction Information and communication technologies (ICT) can make a significant contri- bution to the rural development process, given the growing information and knowledge society. Rural ICT projects, however, are confronted with constraints which threaten sustainability. The sustainability of an ICT project is essential for a long-term positive impact in rural communities. The aim of this research study is to highlight the concept of sustainability, and identify a trend in the factors that contribute towards ICT project sustainability in rural areas, with an exploration of the Dwesa project. Literature on rural development and sustainable ICT is examined. Subse- quently, the derived critical success factors of rural ICT project sustainability are summarized, followed by an exploration of these factors in the Dwesa ICT project. The conclusion summarises the findings and identifies the need to formulate an approach to rural ICT project management that is sensitive to the critical factors that promote rural ICT project sustainability. 2 2 The Significance of Sustainable ICT in Rural Development Rural development is a significant focus for developing countries as the poverty that exists in the world today is predominantly rural (Mwabu and Thorbecke 2001). Rural areas hold substantial human and natural potential which must be harnessed to contribute effectively to development. Information and knowledge are key strategic resources in the rural development process as they provide rural people with the ability to expand their choices through knowing what works best in their communities, hence contributing to development, competitiveness and productivity (Canadian International Development Agency 2003). Access to in- formation and knowledge can be enhanced by ICT, which effectively connects and facilitates information flows between rural communities and more developed re- gions (Heeks 1999; Pade et al. 2006a). Although some rural ICT projects have been successful with major project goals being attained, the challenges associated with ICT use has resulted in projects that either totally fail (the project has ended up not being implemented) or partially fail (major goals have not been attained, hence sustainability failure) (Heeks 2002). The success of an ICT project to enable rural development relies on its ability to be sustainable. Sustainability can be defined as, “Development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future genera- tions to meet their own needs” (NetTel 2005). It can be viewed either as the sus- tainability of ongoing rural ICT access, independent of specific technologies or projects; and/or the sustainability of rural development results through ICT-enabled development (for example, education, health, empowerment) (TeleCommons Development Group (TDG) 2000). The concept of sustainability in most research is closely related to the financial sustainability (cost recovery) of the project. However, it also considers other facets such as rootedness in local communities, cultural and political acceptance, and value to rural individuals (Keniston 2005). Pade et al. (2006b) identify the categories of sustainability that need to be applied in rural ICT projects: Social and Cultural, Institutional, Economic/Financial, Political, and Technological sustainability. It is important that the needs, demands and driving forces of these categories are in harmony and integrated to achieve the overall sustainability of the project (Pade et al. 2006b; Hietanen 2002). The sig- nificance of the development of sustainability implies that ICT project implemen- tation needs to be receptive to critical factors that promote the sustainability of the ICT 3 The Dwesa Case Study Dwesa is a rural area situated within the former Transkei, along the Wild Coast of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It forms part of the Dwesa–Cwebe area which comprises the protected area (nature reserve) and extended frontline (Palmer et al. 2002). The Dwesa–Cwebe area has become involved in a development initiative as the nature reserve and wild coast that they share are a chief asset for the communities (tourism) (Palmer et al. 2002). The vision for development for Dwesa–Cwebe has been to take advantage of their rich natural asset through tour- ism. The land's ownership has recently been restored to the community. The Dwesa ICT project consists of a collaboration of research projects between the Telkom Centres of Excellence (COE) at Rhodes University and the University of Fort Hare. The aim of the project is to develop an open source/standard e-commerce/telecommunications platform to deploy within rural and semi-rural areas in South Africa. The ICT project therefore endeavours to promote e-commerce in tourism (through the nature reserve, a chief community asset) and other rural development activities. The project commenced in November 2005 and provides an opportunity to observe the critical success factors applied to promote sustain- ability. The researchers in the project consist of postgraduate students experiencing an ICT project in context for the first time. Their different research sub-projects support the overall goal of the Dwesa ICT project. This research investigates the Dwesa project at its early stages of development. The project is currently still active within a pilot stage. The Dwesa ICT project team chose to initially implement the project within the Mpume community of Dwesa, at Mpume Primary-Junior Secondary},

abstract = {For many societal decisions, governments and public bodies are beginning to involve stakeholders and the general public to a far greater extent than previously in the decision process. Stakeholder workshops, citizen juries, focus groups, electronic forums, web-polling and many other means of consultation are being used to draw citizens into the process of deciding between different options on the management of their communities. Politicians are drawn to such instruments because greater public involvement seems to achieve greater acceptance of the ultimate decision and, arguably in more objective terms, a better decision. Many academic studies have investigated participation and wider aspects of deliberative democracy and found that the politicians' intuition is borne out in practice. However, while there have been many studies focused on specific instruments of participation, few have compared different ones. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of advice on how to assemble a set of different instruments into a complete participatory decision making process. This paper offers a decision modelling framework which, firstly, provides a methodology which may be used to design participatory processes and, secondly, raises a number of questions which future comparative studies will need to address.},

Information power indicates that the more information the sample holds, relevant for the actual study, the lower amount of participants is needed. We suggest that the size of a sample with sufficient information power depends on (a) the aim of the study, (b) sample specificity, (c) use of established theory, (d) quality of dialogue, and (e) analysis strategy. We present a model where these elements of information and their relevant dimensions are related to information power.

abstract = {We present a three-phase exploration of mobile messaging to address the high rate of maternal mortality in low-income, urban Pakistan, with a focus on identifying deviations from previously published findings about mobile interventions in developing-world health. Phase 1 was a qualitative study of healthcare staff and pregnant mothers. It found that while the deeper medical challenges of maternal mortality were beyond the reach of ICT interventions, many of the problems could be partially addressed through a mobile-phone system that issued health-related information and reminders. In Phase 2, we ran a randomized controlled trial of 180 pregnant mothers split into four arms based on the mode by which the messages were sent – (1) no messages (control), (2) SMS text messages, (3) recorded voice messages, and (4) a combination of SMS and voice messages. Consistent with prior research, we found that mothers receiving messages exhibited dramatic gains in knowledge about pre-natal care, though whether the messages increased follow-up hospital visits was not clear. Phase 3 involved follow-up phone interviews with the participants of the Phase 2 evaluation. Complex family dynamics involving husbands and mothers-in-law mediate the impact of mobile information interventions, with both positive and negative effects.},

@inproceedings{Balasubramanian1998,
abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction researchers have primarily focused on systematic techniques and tools for two phases of the user interface design process: design by prototyping and evaluation. Studies have shown that the advent of a number of rapid prototyping techniques and tools have not significantly reduced the amount of time and costs involved in the design and programming of user interfaces. This is due to the fact that designers do not spend enough time thinking about the design problem; instead, they resort to "aimless" prototyping with a complex set of tools. In this paper, we introduce the need for a formal planning and idea generation phase in the user interface design process prior to prototyping, to minimize the effects of ad hoc design practices. This is the phase when preliminary requirements for an information system are available and the designer starts thinking and planning about the problem, making mental and written notes about it. This phase is similar to the problem formulation and idea generation phases discussed by researchers in the area of creative problem solving. We also propose a systematic design methodology containing fifteen non-sequential, highly connected, and iterative set of design tasks to structure the creative and opportunistic thought processes of the designer with appropriate guidance. A tool called HyperDesign has also been developed, incorporating hypertext functionality, to facilitate application of this methodology during this early phase of interface design. Results from a beta test, with students and professionals, confirmed the need for a planning and idea generation phase during the user interface design process with moderate levels of agreement about the validity, relevance, and usefulness of the proposed methodology. The beta test also revealed that the tool was moderately difficult to use; changes to both the methodology and the software have been proposed which will be incorporated in the next iteration, making it more usable and acceptable by designers.},

Whilst technology access in the pre-digital era has always been a major barrier to economic and social development in developing countries, this is no longer an absolute barrier for at least three reasons: firstly, the proliferation of distributive and open technologies, and limits to the power of proprietary frameworks; secondly, the increasingly lower delivery cost of new technologies; and thirdly, the emergence of multiple sources of technology innovation and development in civil society with specific emphasis on mobile technology. This paper will outline ways to establish community successes using mobile technology as an enabler in the current era of economic uncertainty.

abstract = {Taking care of a premature infant adds an extra burden to already stressed parents. Previous studies have shown that parental stress occurs during the initial hospitalization. However, there is little information on parental stress over time, and the few existing results are conflicting. In addition, many studies have focused on maternal stress but there is little information about a father's long-term adaptation to stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree and type of parenting stress in the families of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants over the first two years of life. We compared parenting stress in families with preterm infants with control families, while also comparing the stress in mothers to that in fathers. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between parenting stress in the preterm group with identified factors that included the infant's age, medical complications, and parents' perceived feeding issues after they had been discharged from the hospital. This was an exploratory study with a cross sectional design. Participants included a total of 505 mothers from Tainan, Taiwan; 297 with preterm children (239 mothers, 58 fathers) and 208 with full-term children (181 mothers, 27 fathers). Assessments including the Parenting Stress Index, Neonatal Medical Index and Behavior-based Feeding Questionnaire were used to measure parental distress, infants' medical complications and parents' perceived feeding issues, respectively. Results of the study, though not statistically significant, indicated the presence of increased parenting stress in parents of preterm infants as compared to parents of full-term infants. 13.1{\%} of mothers with preterm infants demonstrated total stress levels that warranted clinical intervention. We also found that mothers of preterm infants presented different parenting stress patterns than fathers of preterm infants. Fathers of preterm infants tended to have overall higher stress scores than mothers. On the other hand, mothers of preterm infants tended to report more health related difficulties, more depression, higher social isolation and role restriction, and less support from their spouses, than reported by fathers. Moreover, as time went on, parents with preterm infants continued to experience greater parenting stress than those with full-term infants. Understanding the experiences of parents with preterm children is important for health care providers while interviewing parents for information regarding their children and designing intervention programs to improve children's outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Family-centered care is a proposed way of supporting family involvement with a child's care and decreasing distress associated with a child's critical illness by improving communication, helping manage stress and coping, and decreasing conflicts. Nurses are critical to successful implementation of family-centered care. Objectives: To describe nurses' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of providing family-centered care in pediatric intensive care units. Methods: Semistructured interviews of 10 bedside and charge nurses in pediatric, cardiac, and neonatal intensive care units. Questions were related to 4 domains: the intensive care unit environment and its relationship to the structure and delivery of critical care, stressors for nurses and families, communication challenges and strategies, and involvement of families in care and decision-making. Results: The main thematic finding was the nurses' descriptions of a “balancing act” to provide quality family-centered care. The balancing act was characterized by the interaction between 2 types of changes: (1) intensive care unit policies related to visitation hours and family presence at the bedside and (2) physical transformations in the intensive care unit from shared open space to individual private rooms. Conclusions: All of the nurses viewed the transition to family-centered care as having benefits for families. They also described how changes had created new challenges for the delivery of nursing care in intensive care units, particularly regarding mentorship and the safety of patients and staff.

Lisfranc lesions (LFLs) are commonly fracture-dislocations of the Lisfranc joint and are generally caused by high-energy trauma. 1 Since publica-tion of the classification of LFLs by Hardcastle and colleagues, 2 based on the work by Qenu and Kuss, many papers have dealt with their anatomic patterns, treatment and prognosis, each of which is open to questions. However, the main area of controversy has been the modalities of surgical stabilization. 2–4 We report the case of a patient with fracture-dislocation of the Lisfranc joint, treated surgically with the use of K-wires, in which the mechanism of injury was unusual. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old man was driving a minibus barefoot when he lost control of the vehicle, which rolled over and crashed into a tree. His right foot had slipped off the brake pedal, which was defective and not covered by rubber. The pedal pierced his inverted foot and could not be extracted manually. On examination, the pedal was perforating the foot with the entrance wound located on the dorsal aspect and an exit wound at the plantar region (Fig. 1). The medical staff severed and removed the pedal. Radiographs showed dislocation of the tarsometatarsal joint associated with fractures of the cuboid and lateral cuneiform bones and the base of the last 4 metatarsals (Fig. 2). The patient underwent d{\'{e}}bridement, reduction and fixation of the fractures and dislocation with K-wires. There was skin loss on the dorsal aspect of the foot.},

abstract = {Background. Nutrient intakes meeting recommended dietary intakes (RDIs) take time to establish and once established are rarely maintained throughout hospital stay in preterm infants. A nutrient deficit, therefore, accrues. RDI are based on needs for maintenance and growth, with no provision to replace this deficit. We, therefore, hypothesized that postnatal malnutrition and growth retardation were inevitable in infants fed current RDI. Methodology. Dietary intakes were prospectively collected, by a single observer (N.P.), on a daily basis in a group of preterm infants (n = 105; birth weight ≤1750 g; gestational age ≤34 weeks) admitted to neonatal intensive care unit over a 6-month period. Actual was subtracted from recommended energy (120 kcal/kg/day) and protein (3 g/kg/day) intakes and nutritional deficits calculated. Infants were weighed on admission and throughout hospital stay. The data were analyzed using a combination of repeated measures analysis of variance and stepwise regression analysis. Results. Nutrient intakes meeting current RDIs were rarely achieved during early life. By the end of the first week, cumulative energy and protein deficits were 406 ± 92 and 335 ± 86 kcal/kg and 14 ± 3 and 12 ± 4 g/kg in infants ≤30 and those at ≤31 weeks. By the end of the fifth week, cumulative energy and protein deficits were 813 ± 542 and 382 ± 263 kcal/kg and 23 ± 12 and 13 ± 15 g/kg and the z scores were-1.14 ± .6 and-.82 ± .5 for infants at ≤30 and ≥31 weeks. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that variation in dietary intake accounted for 45{\%} of the variation in changes in z score. Conclusions. Preterm infants inevitably accumulate a significant nutrient deficit in the first few weeks of life that will not be replaced when current RDIs are fed. This deficit can be directly related to subsequent postnatal growth retardation.},

abstract = {The concept generation process seems like an intuitional thought: difficult to capture and perform, although everyone is capable of it. It is not an analytical process but a synthetic process which has yet to be clarified. Furthermore, new research methods for investigating the concept generation process-a very difficult task since the concept generation process is driven by inner feelings deeply etched in the mind-are necessary to establish its theory and methodology. Concept Generation for Design Creativity - A Systematized Theory and Methodology presents the concept generation process both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, the concept generation process is discussed by comparing metaphor, abduction, and General Design Theory from the notions of similarities and dissimilarities. Analogy, blending, and integration by thematic relation have been explained methodologically. So far, these theories and methods have been discussed independently, and the relations among them have not been clarified. Two newly developed research methods to investigate the concept generation process are clearly explained: the explanation-based protocol analysis and constructive simulation. By reading Concept Generation for Design Creativity - A Systematized Theory and Methodology, students, researchers and lecturers in design disciplines (including engineering design, industrial design, software design, CHI, design education, and cognitive science ) can obtain a clear picture of the advanced research findings and the outline of the theories and methods for concept generation. Furthermore, readers are expected to achieve the competence to generate new concepts. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London 2013. All rights are reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes a proposed new method for helping to understand the emotional requirements of children during the conceptual phase of designing an interface. The approach may be particularly useful where the feelings of the child are critical, but are difficult to investigate; for example when the issues are sensitive and may provoke emotional responses. Here we explore an approach that draws on the social agency that characters can provide to help the young user articulate their opinion. Children were asked to create fictitious cartoon ‘personalities' that have desired attributes, personal qualities and behaviors that are relevant to a given scenario. Subsequently this influenced the conceptualization of a product under development for the context defined. The devices were being developed for final major projects across both the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex Product Design departments. Character design was found to be an engaging activity for the children, with a tangible outcome that can facilitate communication between the designer and pupil. It also provides a relatively sensitive method for getting information about the youngster's feelings through the dialogue that took place. This forms part of a larger study for a PhD thesis based on designing for children's emotional needs.},

abstract = {Tanzania is striving to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 that call for reducing Neonatal and Maternal Mortality Rate (MNMR) by 2015. In 2010, Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) was recorded at 51 per 1,000 live births and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) at 454 per 100,000 live births. Despite of the devoted efforts and significant progress, still the mortality rate needs attention and effective intervention to cut it down considerably. The capability and power of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) need to be effectively exploited in revolutionizing health sector in Tanzania. The witnessed expansion of mobile phones usage and extended network coverage presents potential opportunity in enhancing quality of Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) services delivery. This paper explores the role of ICT in reducing MMR and NMR, existing solutions are intensely reviewed to discover what is lacking and provide necessary recommendations.},

abstract = {The evaluation of rural ICT for development projects is crucial to understanding the impact of such projects in developing countries. A comprehensive evaluation framework called the Rural ICT Comprehensive Evaluation Framework (RICT-CEF) was developed to capture the relevant impact and effectiveness throughout the life of ICT4D projects in marginalised communities. This report presents the evaluation results of one of the seven evaluation domains of the RICT-CEF; Programme Theory Assessment. A Programme Theory Assessment aims to evaluate whether the conception or logical design of the ICT4D initiative is actually designed to support development programmes or address the needs and priorities of the targeted community. A Programme Theory Assessment was conducted for the Siyakhula Living Lab, an ICT4D project in South Africa. Programme theory was elicited and understood in terms of three interrelated components which include the living lab's organisational plan, service utilisation plan, and the impact theory. These components were assessed based on criteria from the 'access to education and knowledge' need identified in a previous needs assessment, research/project practice, and observation. This report discusses each programme theory component of the Siyakhula Living Lab, and presents the assessment results in terms of the suitability, shortcomings, and recommendations to adjust the existing programme theory. A description of the contribution of the programme theory assessment for subsequent or future evaluations of the Siyakhula Living concludes the report.},

There exists a body of instruments that measure a range of maternal characteristics, such as maternal confidence and self-efficacy. It remains unclear if any of these assessments can be used to measure maternal functioning, which may be a direct indication of potential hazards to the offspring. Accurate assessment of functioning would also aid in identifying women who are struggling in the maternal role. In order to assess whether commonly used maternal assessments extend into the realm of functioning, it is necessary to have an appropriate definition. Therefore, the aims of this analysis are to (1) present a new, patient-centered definition of maternal functional status and (2) evaluate select maternal assessments against this definition.},

Methods: An integrated literature review approach, with searches in the PubMED and Literature in Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences databases, between 1999 and 2011, and with the use of descriptors (premature, neonatal nursing, nursing care and hospital discharge), in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Results: The ten selected studies were categorized into three themes: participation in child care, the preparation for hospital discharge, and use of educational material. Most activities in health education were directed at mothers and were related to basic daily care and, also, beginning participation in these activities in order to promote bonding and enhancing their confidence with care. Conclusion: We observed the need to elaborate strategies, based in active learning methodologies, aided by educational materials that facilitate the inclusion of parents in the neonatal unit, and in caring for their child.},

@article{Wigert2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: From birth the child has an ability to respond to the environment, which influences the interaction between mother and child. If this attachment is interrupted, the child's emotional development is negatively influenced. When the child needs care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) it is difficult to establish contacts between mother and child. Separation from the child is found to be the most difficult aspect for mothers when their newborn child is hospitalized in a NICU. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe mothers' experiences when their full-term newborn child was cared for in a NICU during the postpartum maternity care period. METHOD: A phenomenological hermeneutic interview study was performed. Ten mothers were interviewed once, 6 months to 6 years after the experience. RESULTS: The essence of the experience is understood as an alternation between two opposite concepts, exclusion and participation, with emphasis on exclusion. A feeling of exclusion dominates when the new mother feels a lack of interaction and a sense of not belonging to either the maternity care unit or the NICU. This has a negative effect on her maternal feelings. On the contrary, when a feeling of participation dominates, a continuous dialogue exists and the mother is cared for as a unique person with unique needs. This supports her maternal feelings in a positive direction. The implication of the result for nurses is that it is important to decrease mothers' experience of exclusion and to increase their feeling of participation when their child is cared for in a NICU. A return visit to the responsible nurse to go through the treatment and experiences should be offered to all parents whose child has been cared for in a NICU.},

abstract = {Understanding users becomes increasingly complicated when we grapple with various overlapping attributes of an individual's identity. In this paper we introduce intersectionality as a framework for engaging with the complexity of users'—and authors'—identities, and situating these identities in relation to their contextual surroundings. We conducted a meta-review of identity representation in the CHI proceedings, collecting a corpus of 140 manuscripts on gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality published between 1982-2016. Drawing on this corpus, we analyze how identity is constructed and represented in CHI research to examine intersectionality in a human-computer interaction (HCI) context. We find that previous identity-focused research tends to analyze one facet of identity at a time. Further, research on ethnicity and race lags behind research on gender and socio-economic class. We conclude this paper with recommendations for incorporating intersectionality in HCI research broadly, encouraging clear reporting of context and demographic information, inclusion of author disclosures, and deeper engagement with identity complexities.},

abstract = {Health organizations recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months of life. The current study contributes to a growing body of research that examines whether the purported benefits of breastfeeding are causal. We systematically evaluated the role of an expectant mother's prenatal breastfeeding intentions, which reflect not only demographic characteristics, but also knowledge, attitudes, and social norms about infant feeding, and therefore serve as a proxy for positive maternal selection into breastfeeding. We used the Infant Feeding Practices Study (IFPS) II (n = 1008) to examine a heretofore overlooked group of mothers—those who intended to breastfeed but did not actually breastfeed. Results suggest that mothers who intended to breastfeed had infants with fewer ear infections and respiratory syncytial viruses, and used fewer antibiotics in the first year of life compared to infants whose mothers did not intend to breastfeed, irrespective of whether they actually breastfed. Because breastfeeding intention is a confounding characteristic that proxies for positive maternal selection and does not represent a causal mechanism for infant health, we further examined how mothers who intended to breastfeed differed from mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Results suggest that mothers who intended to breastfeed had more knowledge about potential food contaminants and consulted more sources of information about nutrition and diet than mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Taken together, our results underscore the need for new policy interventions aimed at improving infant health.},

abstract = {Abstract. Whenever information systems are developed, they serve some interests at the expense of others. Just what those interests are and who possesses them need to be understood and debated as they involve value judgments. This paper contends that advice concerning the design of information systems must not be limited to technical design, but should also address what is good or bad, or right or wrong in any particular situation— a notion termed a design ideal. The paper offers an approach on how such value judgments involving competing design ideals may be approached in a rational way. This necessitates the adoption of a wider concept of rationality, one, which allows the insights of critical philosophical analysis to be brought to bear on the question of how information systems can best serve all project stakeholders. In order to address likely objections to our proposal, the conclusions discuss several research issues.},

With 1,033,513 Syrian refugees adding a strain on the Lebanese healthcare system, innovation is key to improving access to healthcare. Our previous work identified the potential for technology to improve access to antenatal care services and increase refugee agency. Using (1) paper mock ups and a mobile based prototype, (2) process mapping, (3) focus groups and interviews and (4) key informant meetings, we explored the concept of refugee led community radio shows to deliver peerled healthcare.1We observed the influence of community radio shows on Syrian refugee health education, community dynamics and community agency in relationships between healthcare providers and refugees. Refugees were positively impacted through situating the technology within the community. We highlight issues around trust, agency, understanding, self-organization and privacy that resulted from running the shows through mock ups and a mobile based prototype. Our findings inform future work in community run radio shows.},

How can we, as a global HCI4D community, work within countries and across them as well? The short-term goal of this event is to link research and practice across disparate HCI4D contexts by creating a forum for conversations where 'HCI4Ders' from across the globe can speak and be heard, as they develop themes of common interests, and work on potential projects or proposals to concretely target an action plan they can pursue as collaborators. Our long-term goal is to advance HCI4D research so that, as a community, we can engage more productively in research conversations that focus on learning and collaborating across borders.},

It should also serve to$\backslash$n enhance the efficiency of health systems themselves and ultimately support the sustainable and$\backslash$n effective use of such services.$\backslash$n The implementation efforts must be based:$\backslash$n 1. on a clear appreciation of the country's current and future public health and healthcare issues and$\backslash$n opportunities, with a definition of the corresponding national priorities;$\backslash$n 2. subsequently, on a medium- to long-term action plan for the use of e-health technologies to meet$\backslash$n healthcare priorities, with gradual renovation of the health systems themselves.$\backslash$n This plan must:$\backslash$n {\textperiodcentered} bring together players from the public sector, not-for-profit organizations and the private sector;$\backslash$n {\textperiodcentered} be structured in the form of a business plan, approved by the stakeholders;$\backslash$n {\textperiodcentered} be backed by a strong commitment on the part of all players;$\backslash$n {\textperiodcentered} include a comprehensive plan for ongoing education and communication with the partners.$\backslash$n If these conditions are met, the chances are more realistic for rapid return on investment, successful$\backslash$n long-term impact, and significant benefits for all concerned.$\backslash$n What we need today is coordinated support from international organizations, donor agencies, other$\backslash$n international sources and the private and public sectors.

This insight may be well understood in the social science context, depending on the research methodology of the particular study. For example, where the methodology involves ethnography, participant observation, several interviews over an extended period of time etc, both the researcher and the participant will grasp that the informed consent process is ongoing. The precise nature of the process depends on the type of methodology.

abstract = {The aim of this article is to be aware the benefits of breastfeeding from mom to the baby of an expectant parent or as a new parent. Breastmilk or human milk is the natural source of nutrition and growth for all infants. The value of breastfeeding and breastmilk for infants has been long recognized as; it is the perfect food for baby; available wherever and whenever baby needs; always at the right temperature, clean and free; no bottles to clean; and has no waste; so it is good for the environment. Breastfeeding reduces child's mortality and has health benefits that extend into adulthood. On a population basis, exclusive breastfeeding for at least first six months of life is the recommended way of feeding to infants, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond. Breastmilk is the natural first food for babies, it provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and this continues to provide up to half or more of a child's nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one-third during the second year of life. In addition to containing all the vitamins and nutrients the baby needs, breastmilk is packed with disease-fighting substances that protect baby from illness. Studies are finding new benefits of breastfeeding by showing that babies who are breastfed are less likely to have fevers after their immunizations than babies who are formula fed. It supplies all the necessary nutrients in the proper proportions; protects against allergies, sickness, obesity, diseases like diabetes and cancer, infections like ear infections; is easily digested with no constipation, diarrhoea or upset of stomach; babies have healthier weights as they grow; and breastfed babies score higher on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. As a result, giving nothing but breastmilk is recommended for about the first six months (26 weeks) of baby's life. After that, giving of breastmilk to baby alongside family foods as long as mom and baby want will help them to grow and develop more healthily. It defends them from contaminations and there is some evidence that it helps them to digest solid foods, and it also continues to provide the balance of nutrients they need},

abstract = {Aims and objectives: To evaluate and adjust systematic implementation of guided family-centred care in a neonatal intensive care unit. Background: Family-centred care is valued in neonatal intensive care units internationally, but innovative strategies are needed to realise the principles. Guided family-centred care was developed to facilitate person-centred communication by bridging the gap between theory and practice in family-centred care. Main mechanisms of guided family-centred care are structured dialogue, reflection and person-centred communication. Design: Qualitative and quantitative data were used to monitor participatory implementation of a systematic approach to training and certification of nurses delivering guided family-centred care. Methods: Systematic implementation of guided family-centred care included workshops, supervised delivery and certification. Evaluation and adjustment of nurse adherence to guided family-centred care was conducted by monitoring (1) knowledge, (2) delivery, (3) practice uptake and (4) certification. Results: Implementation was improved by the development of a strategic framework and by adjusting the framework according to the real-life context of a busy neonatal care unit. Promoting practice uptake was initially underestimated, but nurse guided family-centred care training was improved by increasing the visibility of the study in the unit, demonstrating intervention progress to the nurses and assuring a sense of ownership among nurse leaders and nonguided-family-centred-care-trained nurses. Conclusions: An adjusted framework for guided family-centred care implementation was successful in overcoming barriers and promoting facilitators. Relevance to clinical practice: Insights gained from our pioneering work might help nurses in a similar context to reach their goals of improving family-centred care.

However there is room for more research since maternal mortality is still high in developing countries. Moreover, most initiatives focus on helping health workers to improve service delivery, leaving room for research on how to engage mothers. We therefore propose a system prototype that supports pre-natal and post-natal healthcare by involving the women. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data which was used to generate user and system requirements for the system. Based on the requirements, SMS gateways were evaluated to identify a suitable base for developing the system. The system was evaluated via usability and functionality testing. Results indicate that the implementation may be a feasible way to extend maternal health education to women and to reduce maternal mortality in the long run.},

However, identifying and sampling these populations for research purposes is often fraught with difficulties. Barriers include society's lack of tolerance of diverse groups, social stigma, concern for issues of confidentiality, and fear of exposure because of possible threats to security. Chain referral sampling techniques are proposed to minimize bias while maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Techniques of chain referral sampling are detailed for use in researching sensitive topics and hidden populations. When carefully planned and executed, this sampling design offers transcultural nurse researchers a reasonable method for accessing and studying special populations that are particularly hard-to-reach.},

abstract = {To review e-health interventions for maternal and child health (MCH) and to explore their influence on MCH practices in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). Keyword searches were used to retrieve articles from four databases and the websites of organisations involved in e-health projects for MCH in SSA. A total of 18relevant articles were retrieved using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The researchers reveal the prevalence of the application of mobile phones for MCH care and the influence of the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for delivering MCH information and services to target popu-lations. There is a need to move the application of ICT for MCH care from pilot initiatives to interventions involving all stakeholders on a sub-regional scale. These interven-tions should also adopt an integrated approach that takes care of the information needs at every stage along the continuum of care. It is anticipated that the study would be useful in the evolution and implementation of future ICT-based programmes for MCH in the region.},

Objective: To explore the experiences of parents of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit towards interaction with healthcare professionals during their infants critical care. Design: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of critically ill infants admitted to neonatal intensive care and prospectively enrolled in a study of communication in critical care decision making. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and uploaded into NVivo V.10 to manage and facilitate data analysis. Thematic analysis identified themes representing the data. Results: Nineteen interviews conducted with 14 families identified 4 themes: (1) initial impact of admission affecting transition into the neonatal unit; (2) impact of consistency of care, care givers and information giving; (3) impact of communication in facilitating or hindering parental autonomy, trust, parental expectations and interactions; (4) parental perception of respect and humane touches on the neonatal unit. Conclusion: Factors including the context of infant admission, interprofessional consistency, humane touches of staff and the transition into the culture of the neonatal unit are important issues for parents. These issues warrant further investigation to facilitate individualised family needs, attachment between parents and their baby and the professional team.},

Much of the health research undertaken today involves face-to-face encounters with participants using qualitative methodologies. There is a growing recognition that undertaking qualitative research can pose many difficulties for researchers. However, very little research has focused directly on the experiences of researchers while undertaking qualitative research and the issues that their involvement in the research raises for them.To explore these issues, one-to-one interviews were conducted with 30 qualitative health researchers. A grounded theory analysis revealed that researchers can face a number of challenges while undertaking qualitative research. These include issues relating to rapport development, use of researcher self-disclosure, listening to untold stories, feelings of guilt and vulnerability, leaving the research relationship and researcher exhaustion. These results are discussed and recommendations for researchers involved in qualitative research are made.},

abstract = {The major causes of newborn deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are well-known and countries are gradually implementing evidence-based interventions and strategies to reduce these deaths. Facility-based care provides the best outcome for sick and or small babies; however, little is known about the cost and burden of hospital-based neonatal services on parents in West Africa, the sub-region with the highest global neonatal death burden. To estimate the actual costs borne by parents of newborns hospitalised with birth-associated brain injury (perinatal asphyxia) and preterm/low birth weight, this study examined economic costs using micro-costing bottom-up approach in two referral hospitals operating under the nationwide social health insurance scheme in an urban setting in Ghana. We prospectively assessed the process of care and parental economic costs for 25 out of 159 cases of perinatal asphyxia and 33 out of 337 cases of preterm/low birth weight admitted to hospital on the day of birth over a 3 month period. Results showed that medical-related costs accounted for 66.1{\%} (IQR 49{\%}-81{\%}) of out-of-pocket payments irrespective of health insurance status. On average, families spent 8.1{\%} and 9.1{\%} of their annual income on acute care for preterm/LBW and perinatal asphyxia respectively. The mean out-of-pocket expenditure for preterm/LBW was {\$}147.6 (median {\$}101.8) and for perinatal asphyxia was {\$}132.3 (median {\$}124). The study revealed important gaps in the financing and organization of health service delivery that may impact the quality of care for hospitalised newborns. It also provides information for reviewing complementary health financing options for newborn services and further economic evaluations.},

Premature infants however, remain at risk for developmental delays including communication difficulties. The bonding and attachment experiences of premature infants and their parents are often challenged, further placing these infants at risk for communication difficulties. This study firstly aimed to explore mothers' perceptions of their premature infants' communication. The second aim was to explore the mothers' perceptions of their own role in the communication development of their infants. Methods: A descriptive, longitudinal study was conducted with two mother-infant dyads. Three visits took place in the first year of life. Subjective maternal reports were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Results: Differences in the two mothers' perceptions were noted. The mothers described helping their infants to communicate through physical contact and talking. Risk and protective factors for early communication development are discussed in relation to the findings. Conclusion: The findings support the need for a healthy mother-infant relationship in the first few months of life. Health professionals should support premature infants and their families after discharge in order to help them interact with their infants and encourage attachment and bonding.},

The findings reviewed come from the mechanical engineering discipline, as well as from other engineering and nonengineering disciplines. For each principle, we provide references to various studies as a means of supporting the principle. We also provide a detailed example of each principle. Based on our own experience and based on the many papers reviewed, we provide a succinct list of suggestions for using each principle. Finally, we relate these nine principles to traditional design principles. Ultimately, we believe that the principles introduced here help overcome the challenges of design for the developing world, which are often dominated by designer unfamiliarity with poverty and foreign culture and the constraint of extreme affordability.},

abstract = {Recently interest has grown in applying activity theory, the leading theoretical approach in Russian psychology, to issues of human-computer interaction. This chapter analyzes why experts in the field are looking for an alternative to the currently dominant cognitive approach. The basic principles of activity theory are presented and their implications for human-computer interaction are discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the potential impact of activity theory on studies and design of computer use in real-life settings. THE NEED FOR A THEORY OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION It is generally accepted that the lack of an adequate theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) is one of the most important reasons that progress in the field of HCI is relatively modest, compared with the rate of technological development. People coming to the field of HCI from different disciplines—psychology, computer science, graphics design, and others—have serious problems in coordinating and combining their efforts. For example, typical HCI curricula for undergraduate and graduate students present a mixture of knowledge from various disciplines rather than an integrated perspective. Traditional conceptual approaches cannot provide an appropriate basis for addressing many important aspects of HCI, including computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and cross-cultural aspects of computer use. Consequently the impact of HCI studies on current design practice is limited, with user interface design being based mainly on intuition and expensive trial and error. The form of a suitable HCI theory has been subjected to much debate recently (Carroll, Kellogg, and Rosson 1991). A major trend in the debate has been the growing dissatisfaction with the dominant cognitive approach (Bannon 1991; Wood 1992; Monk et al. 1993). In contrast to the general agreement that current attempts to apply cognitive psychology to HCI are not very successful, there is little agreement on the most promising theoretical alternatives. Proposals vary from an enrichment of the traditional cognitive scheme (Barnard 1991) to a radical shift in paradigms, for example, from scientific experimental studies to ethnographic methodology (see Monk et al. 1993). In this period of theoretical uncertainty there has been a growing interest in activity theory, greatly stimulated by B{\o}dker's works (1989, 1991). She was the first Western researcher who presented the basic ideas and potential benefits of activity theory to the HCI community. Recently, a number of papers discussing the activity theory approach to HCI have appeared in major international journals and conference proceedings (Bannon and). The aim of the present chapter is to summarize current work in activity theory and its implications for the field of human computer-interaction. It examines the main differences between activity theory and cognitive psychology, reviews recent attempts to apply activity theory to HCI, and outlines some directions for further development.

abstract = {Background. Traditional systems of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care predispose parents to increased levels of stress and anxiety due to parental separation from their infant. Parental satisfaction, an indicator of the quality of care, is significantly compromised during prolonged NICU stay. The research is limited in developing countries. Objectives. To assess the parental satisfaction with traditional systems of NICU care in a public sector hospital and to identify the areas that need improvement and can be worked upon. Methods. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview the parents of the neonates on the day of discharge. Fifteen questions were categorised into four domains, namely interpersonal relationships with staff, parents' involvement, staff competence and services offered by the health system. Parental satisfaction level was marked on a three-point Likert scale, 0 corresponding to highly dissatisfied, and 2 to completely satisfied for each of the 15 questions. Results. Out of 100 patients interviewed, communication was the chief determinant of their satisfaction. Parents expressed fair satisfaction levels with regard to the emotional support and encouragement received, but discontent at being unable to look after their own baby and breastfeed the baby. They were satisfied with the competence of the staff. Conclusion. The traditional system of NICU care was not satisfying for the parents in many aspects and changes in the form of family-centred care should be tried for greater parental satisfaction. {\textcopyright} 2017, Health and Medical Publishing Group.

abstract = {Most Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are accustomed to the process of formal ethics review for their evaluation or field trial protocol. Although this process varies by country, the underlying principles are universal. While this process is often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging to navigate-a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet, in many cases, foreign to HCI researchers. Nevertheless, with the increase in new areas of research such as mobile technologies for marginalized populations or assistive technologies, this is a current reality. In this paper we present our experiences and challenges in conducting several studies that evaluate interactive systems in difficult settings, from the perspective of the ethics process. Based on these, we draft recommendations for mitigating the effect of such challenges to the ethical conduct of research. We then issue a call for interaction researchers, together with policy makers, to refine existing ethics guidelines and protocols in order to more accurately capture the particularities of such field-based evaluations, qualitative studies, challenging lab-based evaluations, and ethnographic observations.},

In the wake of globalisation, developing countries have no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges. The last decades saw developing countries taking action to strengthen and modernise their HMIS using the existing ICT. Due to poor economic and communication infrastructure, the process has been limited to national and provincial/region levels leaving behind majority of health workers living in remote/rural areas. Even those with access do not get maximum benefit from ICT advancements due to inadequacies in data quality and lack of data utilisation. Therefore, developing countries need to make deliberate efforts to address constraints threatening to increase technology gap between urban minority and rural majority by setting up favourable policies and appropriate strategies. Concurrently, strategies to improve data quality and utilisation should be instituted to ensure that HMIS has positive impact on people's health. Potential strength from private sector and opportunities for sharing experiences among developing countries should be utilised. Short of this, advancement in ICT will continue to marginalise health workers in developing countries especially those living in remote areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, the main focus of studies of childhood mortality has been the infant and under-five mortality rates. Neonatal mortality (deaths {\textless}28 days of age) has received limited attention, although such deaths account for about 41{\%} of all child deaths. To better assess progress, we developed annual estimates for neonatal mortality rates (NMRs) and neonatal deaths for 193 countries for the period 1990-2009 with forecasts into the future. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We compiled a database of mortality in neonates and children ({\textless}5 years) comprising 3,551 country-years of information. Reliable civil registration data from 1990 to 2009 were available for 38 countries. A statistical model was developed to estimate NMRs for the remaining 155 countries, 17 of which had no national data. Country consultation was undertaken to identify data inputs and review estimates. In 2009, an estimated 3.3 million babies died in the first month of life-compared with 4.6 million neonatal deaths in 1990-and more than half of all neonatal deaths occurred in five countries of the world (44{\%} of global livebirths): India 27.8{\%} (19.6{\%} of global livebirths), Nigeria 7.2{\%} (4.5{\%}), Pakistan 6.9{\%} (4.0{\%}), China 6.4{\%} (13.4{\%}), and Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.6{\%} (2.1{\%}). Between 1990 and 2009, the global NMR declined by 28{\%} from 33.2 deaths per 1,000 livebirths to 23.9. The proportion of child deaths that are in the neonatal period increased in all regions of the world, and globally is now 41{\%}. While NMRs were halved in some regions of the world, Africa's NMR only dropped 17.6{\%} (43.6 to 35.9). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal mortality has declined in all world regions. Progress has been slowest in the regions with high NMRs. Global health programs need to address neonatal deaths more effectively if Millennium Development Goal 4 (two-thirds reduction in child mortality) is to be achieved.},

abstract = {Cultural diversity has become a significant challenge in human- computer interaction (HCI) and in the design of interactive technol- ogy. During the design process, a designer needs to consider how culture affects the ways in which people view, adopt and use tech- nology. Furthermore, cultural issues affect also the design process itself, because design theories and methods are based on particu- lar cultural assumptions that do not hold in every design context. This thesis discusses the specific challenges of cross-cultural design and to what extent the current approaches in cross-cultural HCI have considered them. A new design approach that borrows from worth-centred design and ethnographic research tradition is sug- gested to address the identified challenges of cross-cultural design. A case study about mobile phones in the life of Tanzanian univer- sity students serves as an example of howthe approach can support design by highlighting user values and general patterns of technol- ogy ownership and use in the local context, as well as providing methodological guidance throughout a design project.},

abstract = {Symptom management for persons living with HIV disease is recognized as an extremely important component of care management. This article reports the validation of a new sign and symptom assessment tool designed to assess the intensity of HIV-related symptoms using two samples (study 1: n=247; study 2: n=686) of people living with HIV disease. Study 1 data were collected between 1994 and 1996 before the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Study 2 data were collected between 1997 and 1998 after the wide adoption of HAART therapy. The initial version of the Sign and Symptom Check-List for Persons with HIV Disease (SSC-HIV) included 41 signs and symptoms. This scale was submitted to a principal components factor analysis with a varimax rotation. The final solution reports six factors explaining 68.9{\%} of the variance. The six symptom clusters (factors), the number of items in the factor, and the Cronbach alpha reliability estimates were: malaise/weakness/fatigue (six items, alpha=0.90); confusion/distress (four items, alpha=0.90); fever/chills (four items, alpha=0.85); gastrointestinal discomfort (four items, alpha=0. 81); shortness of breath (three items, alpha=0.79); and nausea/vomiting (three items, alpha=0.77). These six factors have strong reliability estimates and a stable factor structure that supports the construct validity of the 26-item instrument. Additional evidence supports the concurrent validity of the scale as well as its sensitivity to change over time. The final version of the SSC-HIV is a 26-item scale available for use by clinicians and researchers to measure the patient's self-report of HIV-related signs and symptoms.},

@article{Hutchinson2005,
abstract = {The Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesised that much human decision-making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb.},

abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and utility of a thematic analysis approach to synthesising qualitative evidence about parental experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: Admission of infants to the neonatal intensive care unit is usually an unexpected event for parents who can cause them to experience psychosocial difficulties. A qualitative systematic review is the best method for exploring these parents' experiences regarding this type of admission.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Systematic review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Qualitative studies in peer-reviewed journals aimed at understanding parental experiences regarding infant neonatal intensive care unit admission were identified in six electronic databases. Three reviewers selected relevant articles and assessed the quality of the methodological studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify the most common themes in the studies describing parental experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of eighty articles were identified; nine studies were included in this review. Four studies used semistructured interviews, three used interviews, one used self-reporting and one used both focus group and interview methodologies. Common themes across parents' experiences were the stress of hospitalisation, alteration in parenting roles and the impact of infant hospitalisation on psychological health.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Having an infant hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit is a stressful experience for parents. This experience is the result of exposure to different stressors related to the infant's condition, an alteration in parenting roles or the neonatal intensive care unit environment and staffing. These parents suffered negative psychological effects, experienced an interrupted development of a healthy parent-infant attachment and/or felt parental role alteration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study's findings are crucial for neonatal intensive care unit nurses to develop intervention strategies and programmes that help parents to decrease the stress of their experience and to support them in facing this stressful situation.},

Created by the same team who wrote the book Preemies: The Essential Guide for Parents of Premature Babies, the app contains information on medical and developmental issues; suggested questions for parents to ask doctors and nurses to understand their baby's care; a combined baby journal and adult diary with focused prompts to record events and emotions; tools to track growth; and organizing lists for questions to ask, tasks to do, and mementos to collect. The app's pages can be shared by email or Facebook to facilitate communication with family and friends, and printed in PDF and saved. Overall, the app aims to ease parents' distress by providing meaningful parenting activities during a baby's NICU stay and an increased sense of normality, control, and connection.

We present a resulting fixed workshop structure with well- chosen constraints that allows for end users to explore and design new technology and work practices. In these workshops, the systems developers get input to design from observing how users stage and act out current and future use scenarios and improvise new technology to fit their needs. A theoretical framework is presented to explain the creative processes involved and the workshop as a user- centered design method. Our findings encourage us to recommend the presented workshop structure for design projects involving mobility and computer-mediated communication, in particular project where the future use of the resulting products and services also needs to be designed.},

We conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mHealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-SES) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. Our findings highlight that the diversity within low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. Most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. Moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. We further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mHealth intervention adoption. Our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations.},

Methods This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 80 mothers of preterm neonates hospitalized in the NICUs of two hospitals in Iran during 9 months. The mothers were assigned in two groups as cases and controls. The satisfaction level of the mothers was evaluated by using WBPL-Revised1 in both groups on the first and tenth day of the study. Mothers in the case group received the educational program available at www.iranlms.ir/myinfant for 10 days. After 10 days, the satisfaction level of the mothers in both groups was measured by questionnaire again. Result the satisfaction of the mothers increased in both groups after this intervention. However, comparison of the mean scores revealed that the satisfaction of the mothers in the case group increased significantly following the intervention (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion Considering the benefits of internet-based education, its utilization in mothers education programs in NICUs is recommended.

Since overcoming apartheid and adopting a new constitution in 1994, the country has engaged in an authentic process of social change and reconciliation. Equity, including equity in access to health care services, is central to its commitment to repairing apartheid's social damage. Alongside this progressive policy environment, however, pervasive implementation challenges remain. Despite substantial health care expenditures, only a minority of South Africans—some 15 to 20 percent—have a high degree of access to health services. The vast majority of South Africans has very limited access to services and depends on a public health system that struggles to keep up with demand. Since establishing a presence in South Africa in 2005, PATH has developed a diverse project portfolio, a broad and secure funding base, an ever-growing reputation, and evidence of positive impact on the health of the people throughout the country. With offices in Durban, East London, and Johannesburg, PATH's South Africa Country Program is becoming an increasingly visible advocate for the country's human resources, technological capacity, and regional influence.},

abstract = {This paper explores power relations within a participatory health and social needs project that took place in a South Asian community in northern England. The project involved a number of different individuals and agencies, each of which began with a rather different combination of interests, agendas, resources, and power bases. Drawing on detailed observations made during the project, together with a series of evaluation interviews, we explore the ways in which these were continually re-negotiated, within a context of shifting power relations. We use a theoretical framework, derived from different interpretations of power and knowledge, and from Bourdieu's theories of cultural and symbolic capital, to unravel these processes of change. We find shifts in the balance of power over the course of a project are possible, but are often slow and rather limited, because of the self-perpetuating power of those holding symbolic capital to define and maintain the status quo. We conclude that community participation in health and social action research can never be a single event, but should be regarded as an ongoing, iterative process, which may extend far beyond the official bounds of the project itself},

Dr. Ramnath received his Doctorate and Master's degrees in Computer Science from OSU and his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology. Abstract Conflict and cooperation would seem to be ideas that are diametrically opposed to each other. But, in fact, classic work by Piaget on how children and adults learn shows that when learners engage with peers in critical discussion of ideas concerning which they have different understandings, that contributes very effectively to learners developing deep understanding of the concepts involved. At the same time, getting students in undergraduate engineering courses to engage with other students in thoughtful discussion of important concepts is very challenging. It can be especially difficult to get female students and students from other un-derrepresented groups to participate effectively in such discussions. In our work, we exploit the affordances of mobile and web technologies to address these challenges. Our approach not only helps address these challenges, it has a number of other important advantages over face-to-face discussions. We present the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, some details of our prototype implementation, preliminary results from the use of the prototype in a junior/senior level class on Software Engineering, and the design for the next version of the tool.},

abstract = {When mothers of preterm infants are unable to produce sufficient volumes of breastmilk, neonatologists in many Western countries prescribe pasteurized donor breastmilk. Breastmilk has a paradoxical presence in the neonatal intensive care unit: while it has therapeutic properties, it also has the potential to transmit disease. National health authorities and local neonatal intensive care unit policies each delimit the safety of donor milk by focusing on the presence or absence of pathogens. It is in this light that breastmilk from the human milk bank is both sought and legitimated to minimize safety concerns. This research uses data arising from an ethnographic study of two human milk banks and two neonatal intensive care units in the United States, and 73 interviews with milk donors, neonatal intensive care unit parents and clinicians. The primary research question framing the study was ‘What are the underlying processes and practices that have enabled donor milk to be endorsed as a safe and legitimate feeding option in neonatal intensive care units?' This study is framed using three key principles of Latour's ‘new critique', namely, adding to reality rather than debunking it, getting closer to data rather than turning away from fact and creating arenas in which to assemble. As a result, conceptions of donor milk's safety are expanded. This case study of donor milk demonstrates how Latour's new critique can inform science and technology studies approaches to the study of safety in health care.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Empathy is a complex, multi-dimensional concept that has moral, cognitive, emotive and behavioural components. Clinical empathy involves an ability to: (a) understand the patient's situation, per-spective, and feelings (and their attached meanings); (b) to com-municate that understanding and check its accuracy; and (c) to act on that understanding with the patient in a helpful (therapeutic) way. Research on the effect of empathy on health outcomes in pri-mary care is lacking, but studies in mental health and in nursing suggest it plays a key role. Empathy can be improved and successfully taught at medical school, especially if it is embedded in the student's actual experiences with patients. A variety of assessment and feedback techniques have also been used in general medicine, psychiatry, and nursing. Further work is required to determine if clinical empathy needs to be, and can be, improved in the primary care setting.},

The NICU interprofessional (IP) team uses advanced technology to care for the sickest infants in the hospital, some at the edge of viability. Many difficult care decisions are made daily for this vulnerable population. The PPADS tool, a computerized decision support system, aims to augment current NICU decision-making by helping parents make more informed decisions, improving physician-parent communication, increasing parent decision-making satisfaction, decreasing conflict, and increasing decision efficiency when faced with ethically challenging situations. The development and evaluation of the PPADS tool followed a five step methodology: assessing the clinical environment, establishing the design criteria, developing the system design, implementing the system, and performing usability testing. Usability testing of the PPADS tool with parents of neonates who have graduated (survived) from a tertiary level NICU demonstrates the usefulness and ease of use of the tool.},

Part of the problem lies in the differing languages, cultures, motives, and operational constraints of producers and evaluators of eHealth systems and services. This paper reflects on the benefits of and barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration in eHealth, focusing particularly on the relationship between software developers and health services researchers. It argues that the common pattern of silo or parallel working may be ameliorated by developing mutual awareness and respect for each others? methods, epistemologies, and contextual drivers and by recognizing and harnessing potential synergies. Similarities and differences between models and techniques used in both communities are highlighted in order to illustrate the potential for integrated approaches and the strengths of unique paradigms. By sharing information about our research approaches and seeking to actively collaborate in the process of design and evaluation, the aim of achieving technologies that are truly user-informed, fit for context, high quality, and of demonstrated value is more likely to be realized. This may involve embracing new ways of working jointly that are unfamiliar to the stakeholders involved and that challenge disciplinary conventions. It also has policy implications for agencies commissioning research and development in this area.},

abstract = {New lighting technologies create new opportunities that may contribute to people's experience of light. These opportunities are a result of the increased variety and freedom in terms of colour, form factor and connectivity of the lights. To allow people to fully benefit from the potential of such novel lighting systems, there is a need for a new user interaction paradigm. To develop this paradigm, we have to better understand the aspects that play a part in the interaction with lighting, paying special attention to people's motivation for interaction. This paper reports on a context-mapping study that was performed to gain insight in these aspects. As result, we present a set of seven themes that regard the interaction with lighting in the current situation and in the future. These themes provide an overview of the relevant aspects in this domain and contain considerations and opportunities for the design of new interfaces for novel lighting systems. We conclude that people have different levels of lighting needs that are highly dependent on context and that also require control at different levels. The context and lighting needs have a large influence on the extent to which people are motivated to adjust their lighting. Moreover, the lighting interface itself has a large effect on this motivation, mainly influenced by the degrees of freedom, the control location and availability, the degree of automation and general interaction qualities.},

In recent years, developing world researchers have attempted to utilise UCD but with mixed results. The results from two developing world, UCD projects, MuTI Mobile and CyberTracker, have shown that the analysis tools and techniques provided by UCD are useful but difficulties arise when interpreting the analysis findings to produce a requirements specification. In particular, traditional UCD methodologies fail to consider the broader and complex effects of the user's physical and social environments. The field studies also highlighted the limitations of existing early-stage prototyping techniques, such as paper-prototyping. The authors address these issues by presenting several tools and techniques that they feel are more suited to the developing world and essential components of a candidate dasiaUCD4Devpsila methodology. These tools and techniques include the use of dasia4Devpsila frameworks, such as the dasiaReal Access/Real Impactpsila criteria, to highlight pertinent developing world issues, the use of higher fidelity technology artefacts during early stage prototyping, the importance of developing a motivated user group and the need for a progressive participatory design approach.},

The diverse set of user groups, potential customers, and IT-developers could not all be defined at the start. This calls for a different type of iteration than the MUST method suggests. Further, the method presumes the involved stakeholders to be able to spend more time in the project than the stakeholders in this project could commit to. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Prototyping is interwoven with nearly all product, service, and systems development efforts. A prototype is a pre-production representation of some aspect of a concept or final design. Prototyping often predetermines a large portion of resource deployment in development and influences design project success. This review surveys literature sources in engineering, management, design science, and architecture. The study is focused around design prototyping for early stage design. Insights are synthesized from critical review of the literature: key objectives of prototyping, critical review of major techniques, relationships between techniques, and a strategy matrix to connect objectives to techniques. The review is supported with exemplar prototypes provided from industrial design efforts. Techniques are roughly categorized into those that improve the outcomes of prototyping directly, and those that enable prototyping through lowering of cost and time. Compact descriptions of each technique provide a foundation to compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each. The review concludes with a summary of key observations, highlighted opportunities in the research, and a vision of the future of prototyping. This review aims to provide a resource for designers as well as set a trajectory for continuing innovation in the scientific research of design prototyping.},

abstract = {This article describes a prototype system for quantifying bioassays and for exchanging the results of the assays digitally with physicians located off-site. The system uses paper-based microfluidic devices for running multiple assays simultaneously, camera phones or portable scanners for digitizing the intensity of color associated with each colorimetric assay, and established communications infrastructure for transferring the digital information from the assay site to an off-site laboratory for analysis by a trained medical professional; the diagnosis then can be returned directly to the healthcare provider in the field. The microfluidic devices were fabricated in paper using photolithography and were functionalized with reagents for colorimetric assays. The results of the assays were quantified by comparing the intensities of the color developed in each assay with those of calibration curves. An example of this system quantified clinically relevant concentrations of glucose and protein in artificial urine. The combination of patterned paper, a portable method for obtaining digital images, and a method for exchanging results of the assays with off-site diagnosticians offers new opportunities for inexpensive monitoring of health, especially in situations that require physicians to travel to patients (e.g., in the developing world, in emergency management, and during field operations by the military) to obtain diagnostic information that might be obtained more effectively by less valuable personnel.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: The beneficial effects of breastfeeding for mothers and babies are well recognized. When maternal breast milk is not available in sufficient quantity, donor breast milk is recommended as an alternate source of nutrition, particularly in preterm and other high-risk infants. Australia lags behind the rest of the developed world in establishing and promoting human milk banks; there is no human milk bank in South Australia and little is known concerning mothers' perceptions of using human milk banks in that state. Objective: This study explored mothers' knowledge of and attitudes toward human milk banks, to inform the development of human milk banking policies and guidelines in South Australia should a milk bank be established. Methods: In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 mothers who were breastfeeding and/or had preterm or sick babies. In addition, 2 focus groups were conducted—1 with breastfeeding mothers as potential donors (n = 5) and the other with mothers of preterm or high-risk infants (n = 4)—to answer questions raised by early analysis of the individual interview data. Results: Breastfeeding mothers, as potential donors, unanimously supported donating their breast milk to a human milk bank, provided it would be easy (especially if required to drop off milk) and not overly time consuming. Mothers of preterm or sick infants would use a human milk bank if they were assured the milk was safe and appropriate for their babies. Conclusion: Study participants would welcome having access to a human milk bank for both donating and receiving milk in South Australia.},

We describe the design and selection of suitable, context-specific interventions that have the potential to improve postpartum care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study is implemented in rural districts in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique. We used the four steps 'systems thinking' approach to design and select interventions: 1) we conducted a stakeholder analysis to identify and convene stakeholders; 2) we organised stakeholders causal analysis workshops in which the local postpartum situation and challenges and possible interventions were discussed; 3) based on comprehensive needs assessment findings, inputs from the stakeholders and existing knowledge regarding good postpartum care, a list of potential interventions was designed, and; 4) the stakeholders selected and agreed upon final context-specific intervention packages to be implemented to improve postpartum care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Needs assessment findings showed that in all study countries maternal, newborn and child health is a national priority but specific policies for postpartum care are weak and there is very little evidence of effective postpartum care implementation. In the study districts few women received postpartum care during the first week after childbirth (25 {\%} in Burkina Faso, 33 {\%} in Kenya, 41 {\%} in Malawi, 40 {\%} in Mozambique). Based on these findings the interventions selected by stakeholders mainly focused on increasing the availability and provision of postpartum services and improving the quality of postpartum care through strengthening postpartum services and care at facility and community level. This includes the introduction of postpartum home visits, strengthening postpartum outreach services, integration of postpartum services for the mother in child immunisation clinics, distribution of postpartum care guidelines among health workers and upgrading postpartum care knowledge and skills through training.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: There are extensive gaps in availability and provision of postpartum care for mothers and infants. Acknowledging these gaps and involving relevant stakeholders are important to design and select sustainable, context-specific packages of interventions to improve postpartum care.},

abstract = {Background: From birth the child has an ability to respond to the environment, which influences the interaction between mother and child. If this attachment is interrupted, the child's emotional development is negatively influenced. When the child needs care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) it is difficult to establish contacts between mother and child. Separation from the child is found to be the most difficult aspect for mothers when their newborn child is hospitalized in a NICU. Aim: The aim of this study was to describe mothers' experiences when their full-term newborn child was cared for in a NICU during the postpartum maternity care period. Method: A phenomenological hermeneutic interview study was performed. Ten mothers were interviewed once, 6 months to 6 years after the experience. Results: The essence of the experience is understood as an alternation between two opposite concepts, exclusion and participation, with emphasis on exclusion. A feeling of exclusion dominates when the new mother feels a lack of interaction and a sense of not belonging to either the maternity care unit or the NICU. This has a negative effect on her maternal feelings. On the contrary, when a feeling of participation dominates, a continuous dialogue exists and the mother is cared for as a unique person with unique needs. This supports her maternal feelings in a positive direction. The implication of the result for nurses is that it is important to decrease mothers' experience of exclusion and to increase their feeling of participation when their child is cared for in a NICU. A return visit to the responsible nurse to go through the treatment and experiences should be offered to all parents whose child has been cared for in a NICU.},

The method introduces value sensitive stakeholder prompts and designer prompts into a co-design process, creating a particular kind of reflection-on-action cycle. The prompts provide a means for bringing empirical data on values and theoretical perspective into the co-design process.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One area where the use of information and communication technology (ICT), or eHealth, could be developed is the home health care of premature infants. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to investigate whether the use of video conferencing or a web application improves parents' satisfaction in taking care of a premature infant at home and decreases the need of home visits. In addition, nurses' attitudes regarding the use of these tools were examined. METHOD: Thirty-four families were randomized to one of three groups before their premature infant was discharged from the hospital to home health care: a control group receiving standard home health care (13 families); a web group receiving home health care supplemented with the use of a web application (12 families); a video group with home health care supplemented with video conferencing using Skype (9 families). Families and nursing staff answered questionnaires about the usefulness of ICT. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 families. RESULTS: All the parents in the web group found the web application easy to use. 83{\%} of the families thought it was good to have access to their child's data through the application. All the families in the video group found Skype easy to use and were satisfied with the video calls. 88{\%} of the families thought that video calls were better than ordinary phone calls. 33{\%} of the families in the web group and 75{\%} of those in the video group thought the need for home visits was decreased by the web application or Skype. 50{\%} of the families in the web group and 100{\%} of those in the video group thought the web application or the video calls had helped them feel more confident in caring for their child. Most of the nurses were motivated to use ICT but some were reluctant and avoided using the web application and video conferencing. CONCLUSION: The families were satisfied with both the web application and video conferencing. The families readily embraced the use of ICT, whereas motivating some of the nurses to accept and use ICT was a major challenge.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: Priority setting and resource allocation in healthcare organizations often involves the balancing of competing interests and values in the context of hierarchical and politically complex settings with multiple interacting actor relationships. Despite this, few studies have examined the influence of actor and power dynamics on priority setting practices in healthcare organizations. This paper examines the influence of power relations among different actors on the implementation of priority setting and resource allocation processes in public hospitals in Kenya. Methods: We used a qualitative case study approach to examine priority setting and resource allocation practices in two public hospitals in coastal Kenya. We collected data by a combination of in-depth interviews of national level policy makers, hospital managers, and frontline practitioners in the case study hospitals (n = 72), review of documents such as hospital plans and budgets, minutes of meetings and accounting records, and non-participant observations in case study hospitals over a period of 7 months. We applied a combination of two frameworks, Norman Long's actor interface analysis and VeneKlasen and Miller's expressions of power framework to examine and interpret our findings Results: The interactions of actors in the case study hospitals resulted in socially constructed interfaces between: 1) senior managers and middle level managers 2) non-clinical managers and clinicians, and 3) hospital managers and the community. Power imbalances resulted in the exclusion of middle level managers (in one of the hospitals) and clinicians and the community (in both hospitals) from decision making processes. This resulted in, amongst others, perceptions of unfairness, and reduced motivation in hospital staff. It also puts to question the legitimacy of priority setting processes in these hospitals. Conclusions: Designing hospital decision making structures to strengthen participation and inclusion of relevant stakeholders could improve priority setting practices. This should however, be accompanied by measures to empower stakeholders to contribute to decision making.

While this is true for most HCI work, fieldwork in developing regions presents unique challenges due to differences in culture, language, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. As a group of nine HCI4D researchers, we have adopted a systematic approach to reflect on the challenges we have encountered in the field. Arising from this exercise are three contributions: The first is our research method itself, which uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative instruments to elicit and synthesize individual experiences. The second, intended for beginning researchers, is a set of lessons learned and suggested strategies for navigating the unique challenges of HCI4D research. The third, intended for the HCI4D community at large, is a critical reflection on the field itself, inspired by our findings. Topics covered include the incentives and agendas of the research world, the importance of managing expectations, the nature of {\#}8220;participation{\#}8221; in HCI4D, and the conflict between research and development more generally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the challenges of working with culturally and linguistically diverse groups can lead to the exclusion of some communities from research studies, cost effective strategies to encourage access and promote cross-cultural linkages between researchers and ethnic minority participants are essential to ensure their views are heard and their health needs identified. Using bilingual research assistants is one means to achieve this. In a study exploring alcohol and other drug service use by migrant women in Western Australia, bilingual workers were used to assist with participant recruitment and administration of a survey to 268 women who spoke more than 40 different languages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Professional interpreters, bilingual students, bilingual overseas-trained health professionals and community sector bilingual workers were used throughout the research project. For the initial qualitative phase, professional interpreters were used to conduct interviews and focus group sessions, however scheduling conflicts, inflexibility, their inability to help with recruitment and the expense prompted exploration of alternative options for interview interpreting in the quantitative component of the study. Bilingual mature-age students on work placement and overseas-trained health professionals provided good entry into their different community networks and successfully recruited and interviewed participants, often in languages with limited interpreter access. Although both groups required training and supervision, overseas-trained health professionals often had existing research skills, as well as understanding of key issues such as confidentiality and referral processes. Strategies to minimise social desirability bias and the need to set boundaries were discussed during regular debriefing sessions. Having a number of workers recruiting participants also helped minimise the potential for selection bias. The practical and educational experience gained by the bilingual workers was regarded as capacity building and a potentially valuable community resource for future health research projects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: The use of bilingual workers was key to the feasibility and success of the project. The most successful outcomes occurred with students and overseas-trained health professionals who had good community networks for recruitment and the required linguistic skills. By describing the advantages and disadvantages encountered when working with bilingual workers, we offer practical insights to assist other researchers working with linguistically diverse groups.},

abstract = {Background: Many of the 15 million premature babies born worldwide every year survive because of advanced medical interventions. Their parents have intense experiences when their babies are in the intensive care unit (ICU), and these have an impact on their thoughts, feelings and relationships, including their relationships with their premature babies. Objectives: The aim of the study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of parents of premature babies in an ICU. Method: Research design was qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual. A purposive sample of parents with premature babies in an ICU in a private hospital in Johannesburg Gauteng in South Africa was used. Eight parents, four mothers and four fathers, married and either Afrikaans or English-speaking, were included in the study. Data were collected by conducting in-depth phenomenological interviews with them and making use of field notes. Trustworthiness was ensured by implementing the strategies of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice were adhered to throughout the research process. Results: Thematic analyses were utilised to analyse the data. Two themes in the experiences of parents with premature babies in ICU became apparent. Parents experienced thoughts, emotions and hope while their premature babies were in the ICU as well as challenges in their relationships and these challenges influenced their experiences. Recommendations: Mindfulness of intensive care nurses should be facilitated so that intensive care nurses can promote the mental health of parents with premature babies in the ICU. Conclusion: Parents with premature babies in the ICU have thoughts and emotional experiences which include hope and they affect parents' relationships.},

Throughout a series of discovery, and prototyping and evaluation workshops, we successfully engaged young people, their families/carers and clinicians in hospital and community mental health settings in enjoyable and empowering co-design activities. These co-design sessions were largely inspired by young people's extensive use of social media metaphors and were adaptable to their interests, preferences and mood.

abstract = {Preterm babies are prone to serious illness or death during the neonatal period. Without appropriate treatment, those who survive are at increased risk of lifelong disability and poor quality of life. Complications of prematurity are the single largest cause of neonatal death and the second leading cause of deaths among children under the age of 5 years. Global efforts to further reduce child mortality demand urgent action to address preterm birth. Infant death and morbidity following preterm birth can be reduced through interventions provided to the mother before or during pregnancy, and to the preterm infant after birth. Interventions can be directed at all women for primary prevention and reduction of the risk of preterm birth (e.g. smoking cessation programmes) or used to minimize the risk in pregnant women with known risk factors (e.g. progestational agents, cervical cerclage). However, the most beneficial set of maternal interventions are those that could improve survival chances and health outcomes of preterm infants when preterm birth is inevitable. These interventions are provided to the mother shortly before or during the birth process with the aim of overcoming immediate and future health challenges of the preterm infant, such as lung immaturity, susceptibility to infection, and neurological complications. Essential and additional care of the preterm newborn to prevent or treat potential complications is also critical to newborn survival without disability. WHO's},

For a 12-month period beginning July 1988, all live infants born at Groote Schuur Hospital or referred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit were included in the study cohort. The aim of the study was to document the morbidity, mortality, and neurodevelopmental outcome of these infants to 2 years of age. Of 235 liveborn infants, 143 (61{\%}) survived to discharge. One hundred twenty-six infants were born weighing less than 1000 g; 42{\%} survived to discharge. One hundred nine infants weighed 1000 g or more at birth, and 83{\%} survived to discharge. Better survival was documented for infants whose mothers attended antenatal care, who weighed more than 900 g, and who were of greater than 30 weeks' gestation. Eleven infants died in the first 6 months after discharge. One hundred six infants (83{\%} of survivors) underwent Griffiths developmental testing and clinical assessment at 1 year of age. Ninety-six (91{\%}) of these survivors were seen and tested at 2 years of age. Of the 106 infants assessed at 1 year of age, 6 infants had cerebral palsy, 6 were globally developmentally delayed without signs of cerebral palsy, and 1 infant showed significant motor delay with a normal developmental quotient. At 2 years of age 1 additional infant had cerebral palsy and 9 more infants are likely to be mentally retarded. At 2 years of age the major handicap rate was, therefore, 22{\%}. Sixty-nine percent of surviving infants, and all but 1 of the infants with cerebral palsy, were underweight for gestational age at birth. There was a tendency for these underweight-for-gestational-age infants to score less well at 2 years of age. Infants who received ventilation and infants with a birth weight of less than 1000 g were not found to score less well than other infants in the cohort.},

Positivist and interpretivist perspectives have typically dominated discussions of this important methodological issue. I provide an alternative perspective by presenting a critical realist view of generalizing from case findings. I show that critical realism represents a very different view than either positivism or interpretivism. Critical realism recognizes the role of case study research in empirical generalization, theoretical generalization, and theory testing. In contrast, the role of case study research in empirical generalization and theory testing is either ignored or neglected by interpretivism and positivism. Embracing critical realism would therefore enable researchers to more fully explore the potential for case finding generalization.},

abstract = {Frequent and sensitive communication from neonatal staff is important to alleviate parental stress and to ensure that parents understand their baby's condition and progress. It also consequently empowers and involves parents in their baby's care. A lack of regular and informative communication from neonatal staff is a common reason for parental complaint. We sought to assess whether the implementation of a baby diary used as a communication tool would improve parent-staff communication and optimise the parental experience of neonatal care. In this study, parents and carers of babies on our neonatal unit were invited to complete a questionnaire to assess their level of satisfaction with communication by neonatal staff before and after the implementation of the diaries. The diary was designed to act as an aid to improve communication to parents about their baby and thereby complementing face-to face communication and encouraging parental involvement. The study design was a retrospective parental satisfaction questionnaire based on the Department of Health [1] and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [2] quality standards for specialist neonatal care on communication and parental involvement (n=44, response rate 57{\%}). Following implementation of the diary, the questionnaire was repeated on two occasions: one month post implementation (n=17, response rate 23{\%}) and 15 months post implementation (n=44, response rate 65{\%}). More parents in the post-intervention cohort felt they were receiving regular communication from staff, that their questions and concerns were being addressed, and felt involved in their baby's care than in the pre-intervention cohort. In addition, 100{\%} of parents said they liked reading the diary and 94{\%} felt it added to their understanding of how their baby was doing. Our project demonstrates an improvement in parents' satisfaction with communication from neonatal staff following the implementation of individual baby diaries. The diary is a simple, practical, and cost-effective tool to enhance communication between parents and staff in a neonatal unit.},

abstract = {This paper offers a set of sociotechnical principles to guide system design, and some consideration of the role of principles of this kind. The principles extend earlier formulations by Cherns (1976, Human Relations, 29, 783-792; 1987, Human Relations, 40, 153-162). They are intended to apply to the design of new systems, including those incorporating new information technologies and a range of modern management practices and ways of working. They attempt to provide a more integrated perspective than is apparent in existing formulations. The principles are of three broad types: meta, content and process, though they are highly interrelated. They are for use by system managers, users and designers, and by technologists and social scientists. They offer ideas for debate and provide devices through which detailed design discussions can be elaborated. The principles are most likely to be effective if they are relatively freestanding, but supported by relevant methods and tools. The principles are necessary but not sufficient to make a substantial contribution to design practice.},

For this, we use activity theory to focus on two university chemistry professors and the broader activity system in which they work. We analyse their beliefs and past experiences related to teaching, learning, and technology as well as other components of the activity system of teaching chemistry with understanding. We employ a qualitative methodology with phenomenological and symbolic interactionist perspectives. Our findings illustrate various contradictions within and between the components of the activity system. Those include the insufficient level of collaboration, reflection, and communication among faculty members, constraints for reform-based chemistry teaching, limitations of large class sizes, and "poor" design of technology-enhanced classrooms. We propose several possible resolutions to transform undergraduate chemistry education, including the effective utilization of technology-enhanced teaching strategies and building a more uniform culture of teaching within science content departments},

Using the Patient Co-design of Breast Service Project as an example, we describe how patient experiences were captured and understood, the improvements made and implications for future work. Method: We used a six-step process: engage, plan, explore, develop, decide and change. Tools and techniques employed were based on service design approaches. These included patient journey mapping, experience-based surveys and co-design workshops. Results: Information, communication, navigation and co-ordination, and environment emerged as key themes for the Breast Service. And as a result, a suite of improvements were made. Key methodological learnings included using co-design alongside traditional quality improvement methodologies, engaging with patients early, the importance of staff buy-in and the necessity of trying things outside one's comfort zone. Conclusion: Use of co-design within the Breast Service has resulted in tangible improvements and has demonstrated the value of engaging patients and focussing on their experiences. It is recommended that: evaluation phases are factored into future co-design work, further research is conducted on sustainability and funding and support is given to allow co-design to become more widespread throughout New Zealand. {\textcopyright}NZMA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research shows evidence for the importance of physical and emotional closeness for the infant, the parent and the infant-parent dyad. Less is known about how, when and why parents experience emotional closeness to their infants in a neonatal unit (NU), which was the aim of this study., METHODS: A qualitative study using a salutogenic approach to focus on positive health and wellbeing was undertaken in three NUs: one in Sweden, England and Finland. An 'emotional closeness' form was devised, which asked parents to describe moments/situations when, how and why they had felt emotionally close to their infant. Data for 23 parents of preterm infants were analyzed using thematic networks analysis., RESULTS: A global theme of 'pathways for emotional closeness' emerged from the data set. This concept related to how emotional, physical, cognitive and social influences led to feelings of emotional closeness between parents and their infants. The five underpinning organising themes relate to the: Embodied recognition through the power of physical closeness; Reassurance of, and contributing to, infant wellness; Understanding the present and the past; Feeling engaged in the day to day and Spending time and bonding as a family., CONCLUSION: These findings generate important insights into why, how and when parents feel emotionally close. This knowledge contributes to an increased awareness of how to support parents of premature infants to form positive and loving relationships with their infants. Health care staff should create a climate where parents' emotions and their emotional journey are individually supported.},

abstract = {The obesity rate in New Zealand is one of the highest worldwide (31{\%}), with highest rates among Māori (47{\%}) and Pasifika (67{\%}). Codesign was used to develop a culturally tailored, behavior change mHealth intervention for Māori and Pasifika in New Zealand. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the codesign methods and processes and describe how these were used to inform and build a theory-driven approach to the selection of behavioral determinants and change techniques. The codesign approach in this study was based on a partnership between Māori and Pasifika partners and an academic research team. This involved working with communities on opportunity identification, elucidation of needs and desires, knowledge generation, envisaging the mHealth tool, and prototype testing. Models of Māori and Pasifika holistic well-being and health promotion were the basis for identifying key content modules and were applied to relevant determinants of behavior change and theoretically based behavior change techniques from the Theoretical Domains Framework and Behavior Change Taxonomy, respectively. Three key content modules were identified: physical activity, family/whānau [extended family], and healthy eating. Other important themes included mental well-being/stress, connecting, motivation/support, and health literacy. Relevant behavioral determinants were selected, and 17 change techniques were mapped to these determinants. Community partners established that a smartphone app was the optimal vehicle for the intervention. Both Māori and Pasifika versions of the app were developed to ensure features and functionalities were culturally tailored and appealing to users. Codesign enabled and empowered users to tailor the intervention to their cultural needs. By using codesign and applying both ethnic-specific and Western theoretical frameworks of health and behavior change, the mHealth intervention is both evidence based and culturally tailored.},

RESULTS: The survey was completed by 217 mothers, 75{\%} were Black, and 75{\%} reported annual household income below {\$}20 000. Only 56{\%} had a computer with Internet access at home, but 79{\%} used smartphones. Most (79{\%}) have searched the Internet for health information in the past year. Receiving electronic messages about their babies was viewed favorably, and text messaging was the preferred platform. The majority of mothers felt electronic messaging would improve communication but should not replace verbal communication. CONCLUSION: Mobile communication is used widely in this population of NICU mothers and could potentially improve provider– parent communication and reduce parental stress.},

Recent work in cultural theory claims that this “in-between” region, or “third space,” is a fertile environment in which participants can combine diverse knowledges into new insights and plans for action, to inform the needs of their organizations, institutions, products, and services. Important attributes of third space experiences include challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many- voiced) dialogues across and through differences. The chapter focuses on participatory practices that share these attributes, including: site-selection of PD work; workshops; story-collecting and story-telling through text, photography, and drama; games for analysis and design; and the co- creation of descriptive and functional prototypes.},

By April 2015 all NHS patients attending any type of healthcare facility in England will be invited to report back on their experiences using a variant of the friends and family test (FFT)—how likely are you to recommend our service to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment? Real time feedback, often gathered on-site using handheld electronic devices, has been introduced into many hospitals over the past few years, and since 2013 it has been mandatory to offer all patients in acute hospitals and maternity services an opportunity to complete the FFT.1 In December 2014 the requirement will be extended to general practice, community, and mental health patients and then to all remaining services over the following three months. This survey is just the latest in a series of government led initiatives to measure patients' experience (box 1). However, less effort has gone into how to understand and use the data, and there is little evidence that the information has led to improvements in the quality of healthcare. We suggest how the data could be used more effectively.},

abstract = {Pioneered in Scandinavia in the 1970s, participatory design (PD) has been recognized as an empowering, sensitive and inclusive approach. Thus it has been applied in a wide variety of fields, from architecture to teaching to game design. One of the goals of PD is to challenge the power imbalance, with the aim of reducing the power differential between researchers and participants. This paper borrows from Foucault's ideas that power is relations of force as a theoretical guideline, to explore how power is exercised at the individual level in the case of a game design project. Recommendations are provided to help researchers overcome such issues in facilitating PD projects.},

abstract = {Two forces are converging, creating conditions both challenging and potentially fruitful for occupational therapy. The profession's knowledge base describing occupation is growing exponentially. At the same time, functional outcomes of intervention are being increasingly valued within the health care environment. Other professions imitate and claim our areas of expertise in the most flattering and dangerous ways. To benefit from the convergence of these forces, occupational therapy must expeditiously translate understanding of occupation into powerful occupation-based practice. Three bridges must be built: a generative discourse, demonstration sites, and effective education. The occupational design approach offers important conceptual tools with which to rapidly build these bridges to powerful practice. Described here are subjective and contextual dimensions of occupational experience, elements of the occupational design process, and how these factors produce therapeutic power through the appeal, intactness, and accuracy of interventions.},

The results showed that participants found limitations with the current iteration of digital method negatively affected their perceptions regarding ease of use compared to the paper-based method. However, behavioural intention showed a positive trend towards future selection of digital-based methods over paper-based methods.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Transitioning premature infants from the NICU to home is a high-risk period with potential for compromised care. Parental stress is high, and families of low socioeconomic status may face additional challenges. Home visiting programs have been used to help this transition, with mixed success. We sought to understand the experiences of at-risk families during this transition to inform interventions. METHODS Mothers of infants born at {\textless}35 weeks' gestation, meeting low socioeconomic status criteria, were interviewed by telephone 30 days after discharge to assess caregiver experiences of discharge and perceptions of home visitors (HVs). We generated salient themes by using grounded theory and the constant comparative method. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS Twenty-seven mothers completed interviews. Eighty-five percent were black, and 81{\%} had Medicaid insurance. Concern about infants' health and fragility was the primary theme identified, with mothers reporting substantial stress going from a highly monitored NICU to an unmonitored home. Issues with trust and informational consistency were mentioned frequently and could threaten mothers' willingness to engage with providers. Strong family networks and determination compensated for limited economic resources, although many felt isolated. Mothers appreciated HVs' ability to address infant health but preferred nurses over lay health workers. CONCLUSIONS Low-income mothers experience significant anxiety about the transition from the NICU to home. Families value HVs who are trustworthy and have relevant medical knowledge about prematurity. Interventions to improve transition would benefit by incorporating parental input and facilitating trust and consistency in communication.},

Results of randomised controlled trials suggest that attempts to reduce these risk factors by use of drugs are limited by side-effects and poor efficacy. An improved understanding of the physiological pathways that regulate uterine contraction and relaxation in animals and people has, however, helped to define the complex processes that underlie parturition (term and preterm), and has led to new scientific approaches for myometrial modulation.

We conducted a qualitative study to this effect, conceptualizing internet health information access as a disintermediation process, and examining this phenomenon through the dimensions of meanings ascribed, power dynamics and social norms. We found that physicians' perceptions about internet informed patients and their interactions with these patients were largely adversarial. However, some physicians viewed the phenomenon as inevitable. They developed methods that leveraged patients' internet access for the purpose of increasing patient awareness and self-efficacy. We conceptualize this new role of physicians as apomediation, and present recommendations for design and implementation of health information platforms in countries such as India, where power dynamics form a salient part of physician-patient interactions.},

@article{Elsbernd2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults with cancer face significant challenges during the course of their medical treatment and recovery from illness. Many adolescents and young adults struggle with long-term complications in the physical, psychosocial, economic, and academic domains. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an innovative platform for delivering supportive care, particularly through the utilization of apps on smartphones and tablets. To create a successful mHealth intervention for adolescents and young adults, youth input and feedback is essential. The process of cocreation, in which the target app user has a direct role in dictating design and function, was utilized to create the prototype smartphone app for adolescents and young adults with cancer, "Kraeftvaerket." OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol for the evaluation of the Kraeftvaerket app, a prototype app designed via cocreation, to support and improve health-related quality of life for adolescents and young adults with cancer. METHODS: The Kraeftvaerket app has three primary features, (1) a symptom and activity diary, (2) a supportive communication network between app users, and (3) a "one-stop shop" information bank with practical information as well as links to patient organizations and other resources. The app will be evaluated in two phases, a pilot test and an implementation test. In the pilot test, the app will be launched to a test group of 20 adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 29 years, selected for equal representation amongst age group and treatment status. Patients will be allowed to utilize the app over the course of six weeks and will complete a baseline and follow-up European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) health-related quality of life inventory. In addition, participant focus group interviews will be conducted according to a semistructured interview guide. Resulting data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Results and appropriate analysis from both the qualitative and quantitative branches of the pilot test will be discussed amongst the research group, and appropriate changes based on user feedback will be made to the app before the final project phase. In the implementation test, the app will be provided and utilized by a sample of 50 adolescents and young adults aged 15-29 years selected for equal representation amongst gender, age group, diagnosis, and treatment status over the course of 3 months. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline and follow-up EORTC QLQ-C30 HRQoL inventory. RESULTS: Pilot testing is expected to take place in February 2018, and implementation testing is expected to begin May 2018. CONCLUSIONS: It is the hope that Kraeftvaerket app will serve as a beneficial and easily utilized product. The process of evaluating the app and its effect on quality of life will address the absence of evidence-based mHealth interventions, and attempt to validate new approaches to benefitting adolescents and young adult oncology patients in the digital world.

abstract = {Since the emergence of the first Social Networking Site (SNS) as a new means of communicating with other people, much research has attempted to identify empirically and theoretically the characteristics, history, and impact on human relationships of both SNSs and their users. This study identifies SNS users as either persistent or temporary, based on their intention to continue using SNSs. To test these hypotheses, this study has amended the Expectation Confirmation Model of IS continuance (ECM-IS) by incorporating Perceived Characteristics of Innovation (PCI) from Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). A total of 158 participants were recruited for this study using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The study concludes that SNS user confirmation, PCI, and satisfaction are significant parameters of SNS users' intention to continue using SNSs. Research limitations and future research are also discussed.},

This model carries with it a number of assumptions whose implications for medical informatics deserve examination. In this paper, we describe the conventional wisdom on evaluation, pointing out some of its underlying assumptions and suggesting that these assumptions are problematic when applied to some aspects of evaluation. In particular, we believe that these assumptions contribute to the problem of user acceptance.

abstract = {UNLABELLED This study was conducted to identify the effects of kangaroo care on the physiological functions of preterm infants, maternal-infant attachment, and maternal stress. DESIGN AND METHODS For this study, a quasi-experiment design was used with a nonequivalent control group, and a pre- and post-test. Data were collected from preterm infants with corrected gestational ages of ≥33weeks who were hospitalized between May and October 2011. Twenty infants were assigned to the experimental group and 20 to the control group. As an intervention, kangaroo care was provided in 30-min sessions conducted thrice a week for a total of 10 times. The collected data were analyzed by using the t test, repeated-measures ANOVA, and the ANCOVA test. RESULTS After kangaroo care, the respiration rate significantly differed between the two groups (F=5.701, p=.020). The experimental group had higher maternal-infant attachment scores (F=25.881, p{\textless}.001) and lower maternal stress scores (F=47.320, p{\textless}.001) than the control group after the test. In other words, kangaroo care showed significantly positive effects on stabilizing infant physiological functions such as respiration rate, increasing maternal-infant attachment, and reducing maternal stress. CONCLUSION This study suggests that kangaroo care can be used to promote emotional bonding and support between mothers and their babies, and to stabilize the physiological functions of premature babies. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Kangaroo care may be one of the most effective nursing interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit for the care of preterm infants and their mothers.},

abstract = {AIM: To measure the perceptions of parent support by parents, nurses and physicians.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Perceptions were compared among parents (n = 227), nurses (n = 178) and physicians (n = 43) in four neonatal intensive care units (NICU) using two versions of the Nurse Parent Support Tool (NPST and NPSTpro).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, parents reported receiving support from nurses some or most of the time and their perceptions were correlated with aspects of their NICU experience. Nurses reported giving support to parents almost all of the time. The mean difference between parent and nurse ratings was smallest for instrumental support (0.26, 0.16-0.36; p {\textless} 0.001) and greatest for emotional support (0.82, 0.67-0.97; p {\textless} 0.001). Physicians overall reported that they gave support to parents most of the time, significantly less frequently than nurses (mean difference 0.58, 0.45-0.71; p {\textless} 0.001). They rated their support as most frequent on answering parents' questions satisfactorily and as least frequent on teaching parents how to give care to their baby.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: NICU nurses and physicians should be encouraged to critically reflect on whether the type and consistency of support they provide to parents is in line with parents' perceptions and needs. Further research is needed on effective methods for health professionals to support parents of NICU infants.},

abstract = {When parents voice their dissatisfaction with the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), it is often not because they think their baby has not received good medical care. Instead, it is often because their needs have not been addressed. Policy statements and pedagogy alike urge professionals to be empathetic, compassionate, honest, and caring. However, these theoretical concepts are generally endorsed without practical suggestions on how to achieve these goals. Negative encounters for parents are generally not about the caregivers' technical expertise or knowledge and often reflect a failure in a different domain. Simple rules of etiquette are not always applied in a busy NICU or in the hospital at large. The investigators of the POST (Parents from the Other Side of Treatment) group are health care professionals who regularly communicate with parents of sick children and who were also "NICU parents." We have developed an etiquette-based systematic approach to communication with families in the NICU. These specific and practical recommendations may help parents feel well treated and respected as they go through a challenging NICU stay.},

abstract = {South Africa is one of only 12 countries in which mortality rates for children have increased since the baseline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 1990. Continuing poverty and the HIV/AIDS epidemic are important factors. Additionally, suboptimum implementation of high-impact interventions limits programme eff ectiveness; between a quarter and half of maternal, neonatal, and child deaths in national audits have an avoidable health-system factor contributing to the death. Using the LiST model, we estimate that 11 500 infants' lives could be saved by eff ective implementation of basic neonatal care at 95{\%} coverage. Similar coverage of dual-therapy prevention of mother-tochild transmission with appropriate feeding choices could save 37 200 children's lives in South Africa per year in 2015 compared with 2008. These interventions would also avert many maternal deaths and stillbirths. The total cost of such a target package is US{\$}1{\textperiodcentered}5 billion per year, 24{\%} of the public-sector health expenditure; the incremental cost is {\$}220 million per year. Such progress would put South Africa squarely on track to meet MDG 4 and probably also MDG 5.

abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Aims of this article were (a) to explore how parents of premature infants experience guided family-centred care (GFCC), and (b) to compare how parents receiving GFCC versus standard care (SC) describe nurse-parent communication in the neonatal intensive care unit. BACKGROUND: Family-centred care (FCC) is acknowledged as fundamental to supporting parents of premature infants, and communication is central to this practice. Accordingly, nurses need good communication skills. GFCC is an intervention developed to improve nurse-parent communication in the neonatal intensive care unit. This intervention helps nurses to realize person-centred communication as an approach to optimize contemporary practice. DESIGN: Our qualitative study had a descriptive and comparative design using semi-structured interviews to explore the parent's experience of GFCC. METHODS: We conducted 10 dyad interviews with parents (n = 20) and two individual interviews with mothers of premature infants (n = 2). Parents in the intervention group versus SC group were 13 versus 9. Thematic analysis was applied. FINDINGS: GFCC was generally experienced as supportive. Three interrelated themes were identified that illustrated how the intervention helped parents cope as persons, parents and couples: (a) discovering and expressing emotions, (b) reaching a deeper level of communication, and (c) obtaining mutual understanding. In contrast, SC communication was more superficial and less structured. Factors such as inaccessibility of nurses, inability to ask for assistance and parent popularity impaired successful communication. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study suggested that compared to SC, GFCC provided structured delivery of supportive communication between nurses and parents of premature infants. The intervention promoted the discovery of the parents' individual preferences and concerns, which enabled more focused communication, and set the stage for better nurse-parent and parent-parent understanding. We recommend GFCC as a method to improve communication in the neonatal intensive care unit.},

The study is idiographic and primarily qualitative and is grounded in the detailed case-studies of individual women going through the transition, prioritizing their own accounts of the experience. The study employs an interpretative phenomenological analysis of interviews, diaries and reperto y grids. The paper presents a processual model of the transition. Key components of the model attend to the women's perception of their social roles. It suggests that during pregnancy a woman's focus may turn from the public world of work towards the more local world of family and friends. This shift may help with the woman's preparation for the new role she is taking on and may furthermore contribute to a transformation of the woman's subsequent life plans. Examples from the women's accounts illustrate each component of the model. The theoretical model is then discussed in relation to the existing literature},

Academic re- search on HIT design and evaluation is an extremely important source of informa- tion in providing new insights into factors contributing to successful system (re)design efforts, system user-friendliness and usability issues and safety critical aspects of HIT design. However, these studies have been inconsistent and incom- prehensive in their reporting, complicating the appraisal of outcomes, generaliza- bility of study findings, meta-analysis and harmonization of the available evi- dence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two interesting health care trends are currently occurring: 1) patient-facing technologies, such as personal health records, patient portals, and mobile health apps, are being adopted at rapid rates, and 2) primary care, which includes family practice, is being promoted as essential to reducing health care costs and improving health care outcomes. While these trends are notable and commendable, both remain subject to significant fragmentation and incentive misalignments, which has resulted in significant data coordination and value generation challenges. In particular, patient-facing technologies designed to increase care coordination, often fall prey to the very digital fragmentation issues they are supposed to overcome. Additionally, primary care providers are treating patients that may have considerable health information histories, but generating a single view of such multi-source data is nearly impossible. DISCUSSION: We contribute to this debate by proposing that primary care practices become digital health information hubs for their patients. Such hubs would offer health data coordination in a medically professional setting with the benefits of expert, trustworthy advice coupled with active patient engagement. We acknowledge challenges including: costs, information quality and provenance, willingness-to-share information and records, willingness-to-use (by both providers and patients), primary care scope creep, and determinations of technical and process effectiveness. Even with such potential challenges, we strongly believe that more debate is needed on this topic prior to full implementation of various health information technology incentives and reform programs currently being designed and enacted throughout the world. Ultimately, if we do not provide a meaningful way for the full spectrum of health information to be used by both providers and patients, especially early in the health care continuum, effectively improving health outcomes may remain elusive. We view the primary care practice as a central component of digital information coordination, especially when considering the current challenges of digital health information fragmentation. Given these fragmentation issues and the emphasis on primary care as central to improving health and lower overall health care costs, we suggest that primary care practices should embrace their evolving role and should seek to become digital health information hubs for their patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both breastfeeding pattern and duration are associated with postnatal HIV acquisition; their relative contribution has not been reliably quantified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pooled data from 2 cohorts: in urban West Africa where breastfeeding cessation at 4 months was recommended but exclusive breastfeeding was rare (Ditrame Plus, DP); in rural South Africa where high rates of exclusive breastfeeding were achieved, but with longer duration (Vertical Transmission Study, VTS). 18-months HIV postnatal transmission (PT) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier in infants who were HIV negative, and assumed uninfected, at age {\textgreater}1 month. Censoring with (to assess impact of mode of breastfeeding) and without (to assess effect of breastfeeding duration) breastfeeding cessation considered as a competing event. Of 1195 breastfed infants, not HIV-infected perinatally, 38{\%} DP and 83{\%} VTS children were still breastfed at age 6 months. By age 3 months, 66{\%} of VTS children were exclusively breastfed since birth and 55{\%} of DP infants predominantly breastfed (breastmilk+water-based drinks). 18-month PT risk (95{\%}CI) in VTS was double that in DP: 9{\%} (7-11) and 5{\%} (3-8), respectively (p = 0.03). However, once duration of breastfeeding was allowed for in a competing risk analysis assuming that all children would have been breastfed for 18-month, the estimated PT risk was 16{\%} (8-28) in DP and 14{\%} (10-18) in VTS (p = 0.32). 18-months PT risk was 3.9{\%} (2.3-6.5) among infants breastfed for less than 6 months, and 8.7{\%} (6.8-11.0) among children breastfed for more than 6 months; crude hazard ratio (HR): 2.1 (1.2-3.7), p = 0.02; adjusted HR 1.8 (0.9-3.4), p = 0.06. In individual analyses of PT rates for specific breastfeeding durations, risks among children exclusively breastfed were very similar to those in children predominantly breastfed for the same period. Children exposed to solid foods during the first 2 months of life were 2.9 (1.1-8.0) times more likely to be infected postnatally than children never exposed to solids this early (adjusted competing risk analysis, p = 0.04).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding duration is a major determinant of postnatal HIV transmission. The PT risk did not differ between exclusively and predominantly breastfed children; the negative effect of mixed breastfeeding with solids on PT were confirmed.},

Up until recently, with technology design, pur- pose and use being in the hands of ‘experts' there was little opportunity for customisation. However, ICT bring toge- ther various threads that make open many new possibilities. Not only are technologies cheaper, more powerful and more available than ever, but now parents, support agen- cies and people with autism spectrum disorders expect information technologies to be part of their worlds, and they have the capacity to participate in co-design for customisation. However, co-design techniques have not evolved to the extent that they capture this potential democratisation of the ICT.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low birthweight (LBW) babies account for {\textgreater}80{\%} of neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and those who survive the neonatal period are still at risk of detrimental outcomes. LBW is a major public health problem in Malawi and strongly contributes to the country's high neonatal mortality rate. We aimed to get a better understanding of the care of LBW babies in rural Malawi in order to inform action to improve their outcomes. METHODS: Qualitative methods were used to identify challenges faced by caregivers and health workers within communities and at the rural facility level. We conducted 33 in-depth interviews (18 with caregivers; 15 with health workers) and 4 focus group discussions with caregivers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated. Thematic analysis was used to index the data into themes and develop a robust analytical framework. RESULTS: Caregivers referred to LBW babies as weak, with poor health, stunted growth, developmental problems and lack of intelligence. Poor nutrition of the mother and illnesses during pregnancy were perceived to be important causes of LBW. Discrimination and stigma were described as a major challenge faced by carers of LBW babies. Problems related to feeding and the high burden of care were seen as another major challenge. Health workers described a lack of resources in health facilities, lack of adherence to counselling provided to carers and difficulties with continuity of care and follow-up in the community. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that care of LBW babies in rural Malawi is compromised both at community and rural facility level with poverty and existing community perceptions constituting the main challenges. To make progress in reducing neonatal mortality and promoting better outcomes, we must develop integrated community-based care packages, improve care at facility level and strengthen the links between them.},

Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform.},

In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as “designers” (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies},

Using$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTwitter posts, we quantify postpartum changes in 376$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmothers along dimensions of social engagement, emotion,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsocial network, and linguistic style. We then construct$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstatistical models from a training set of observations of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthese measures before and after the reported childbirth, to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nforecast significant postpartum changes in mothers. The$\backslash$r$\backslash$npredictive models can classify mothers who will change$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsignificantly following childbirth with an accuracy of 71{\%},$\backslash$r$\backslash$nusing observations about their prenatal behavior, and as$\backslash$r$\backslash$naccurately as 80-83{\%} when additionally leveraging the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninitial 2-3 weeks of postnatal data.

Our experiences with the approach highlighted areas where designers and participants held radically different views. The tenet of our approach was that to overcome these differences we needed to create an empathic relationship between participants and designers. To achieve this we modified participatory design techniques to foster respectful engagement with participants in the development of a digital aid to facilitate 'safe walking'. The process begins with broad qualitative scoping and design work then moves to developing personally tailored, individual designs to further exploration of the experiential elements of the domain while reducing the need for the participants to engage in abstract thought. Reflection highlights a number of important areas that demand consideration when undertaking research in this area and, more generally, when performing design work with people with dementia.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Staff who provide end-of-life care to children not only have to deal with their own sense of loss but also that of bereaved families. There is a dearth of knowledge on how they cope with these challenges. AIM The aim of this review is to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals who provide end-of-life care to children in order to inform the development of interventions to support them, thereby improving the quality of paediatric care for both children and their families. DATA SOURCES Searches included CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsychINFO and The Cochrane Library in June 2015, with no date restrictions. Additional literature was uncovered from searching reference lists of relevant studies, along with contacting experts in the field of paediatric palliative care. DESIGN This was a systematic mixed studies review. Study selection, appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent researchers. Integrative thematic analysis was used to synthesise the data. RESULTS The 16 qualitative, 6 quantitative and 8 mixed-method studies identified included healthcare professionals in a range of settings. Key themes identified rewards and challenges of providing end-of-life care to children, the impact on staff's personal and professional lives, coping strategies and key approaches to help support staff in their role. CONCLUSION Education focusing on the unique challenges of providing end-of-life care to children and the importance of self-care, along with timely multidisciplinary debriefing, are key strategies for improving healthcare staff's experiences, and as such the quality of care they provide.},

@article{Janssen2017,
abstract = {Angiogenesis and the development of metastases are intrinsically connected. Experimental data suggest that establishment and growth of metastases are influenced by soluble factors secreted from the originating solid tumor. Among these factors are so-called endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis which keep metastasis in a non-proliferating quiescent state. For a number of tumors it has been shown that this dormant state is mediated through inhibition of angiogenesis. This dormant state is characterized by normal proliferation, increased apoptosis, and insufficient neo-vascularization. Removal of inhibiting anti-angiogenic factors led to growth of dormant metastases. A number of endogenous inhibitors have been identified and have shown success in experimental therapeutic trials. This might be of special interest for the treatment of cerebral metastases which are the most common type of malignant brain tumors. Similar to the spread of metastases, it is known that single glioma cells can be found in distant parts of the brain. While local recurrence is a common phenomenon in glioma, formation of clinical apparent distant metastasis occurs rarely. Several lines of evidence suggest that growth inhibition of remote glioma cells may be mediated by an endogenous inhibitory mechanism.},

Self-management support goes beyond traditional knowledge-based patient education to include processes that develop patient problem-solving skills, improve self-efficacy, and support application of knowledge in real-life situations that matter to patients. This approach also encompasses system-focused changes in the primary care environment. Family physicians can support patient self-management by structuring patient-physician interactions to identify problems from the patient perspective, making office environment changes that remove self-management barriers, and providing education individually and through available community self-management resources. The emerging evidence supports the implementation of practice strategies that are conducive to patient self-management and improved patient outcomes among chronically ill patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Implementation science research, especially when using participatory and co-design approaches, raises unique challenges for research ethics committees. Such challenges may be poorly addressed by approval and governance mechanisms that were developed for more traditional research approaches such as randomised controlled trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Implementation science commonly involves the partnership of researchers and stakeholders, attempting to understand and encourage uptake of completed or piloted research. A co-creation approach involves collaboration between researchers and end users from the onset, in question framing, research design and delivery, and influencing strategy, with implementation and broader dissemination strategies part of its design from gestation. A defining feature of co-creation is its emergent and adaptive nature, making detailed pre-specification of interventions and outcome measures impossible. This methodology sits oddly with ethics committee protocols that require precise pre-definition of interventions, mode of delivery, outcome measurements, and the role of study participants. But the strict (and, some would say, inflexible) requirements of ethics committees were developed for a purpose - to protect participants from harm and help ensure the rigour and transparency of studies. We propose some guiding principles to help square this circle. First, ethics committees should acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of research approaches, both formally (through training) and informally (by promoting debate and discussion); without active support, their members may not understand or value participatory designs. Second, ground rules should be established for co-design applications (e.g. how to judge when 'consultation' or 'engagement' becomes research) and communicated to committee members and stakeholders. Third, the benefits of power-sharing should be recognised and credit given to measures likely to support this important goal, especially in research with vulnerable communities. Co-design is considered best practice, for example, in research involving indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Australia and Canada.},

As most working mothers have to juggle more than one role, work-life balance is a critical component of their wellbeing. Using concepts from Sen's Capability Approach, this study elucidates how working mothers use smartphones to generate capabilities that allow them to juggle work and family responsibilities. Fifteen participants were purposively selected to study a variety of experiences and views regarding smartphones as experienced by working mothers. The sample differed in terms of age, race, marital status and employment industry. We used semi-structured interviews to collect data, followed by thematic analysis. The research revealed that smartphones enable a variety of capabilities for working mothers. These include capabilities for mothering, connectedness, domestic support, and career support. The capabilities were further elucidated by showing the specific valued ‘beings' and ‘doings' (functionings) under each capability that working mothers could possibly derive. Despite the opportunities for work-life balance offered by smartphones, we found that the biggest barrier to working mothers' actual realisation of most functionings was the cost of data.},

This problem, according to Friedmann, is "our ambivalence about power." Friedmann rightly argues that this ambivalence exists in all major schools of planning thought from the rational planning paradigm to the knowledge/action theory of planning to the communicative paradigm. Friedmann says, furthermore, that one of the things he would do differently today in thinking about planning is introducing "the inevitable question of power" (p. 250). Friedmann closes his paper by encouraging planning researchers to ponder the question of power with a point of departure in what is actually happening in city politics and planning, as opposed to what we normatively would like to see happen, the latter being the classic, and problematic, approach of planning research (pp. 252-253): I would like to urge those of us who are committed to the further development of planning theory to build relations of power--and especially enabling power--into our conceptual framework. This will be done more readily once we ground our theorizing in the actual politics of city-building.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a case study focusing on information and communication design in indigenous villages of rural India. The villages examined for this study were geographically remote and socioeconomically underdeveloped, and their populations represented individuals who possessed low levels of literacy, limited language profi ciency in English and mainstream Indic languages (e.g., Hindi and Bengali), and limited familiarity with computer us and computing practices. The authors sought to examine this context by conducting ethnographic fi eld research involving a variety of methods. Through these approaches, the authors found a range of cultural and contextual factors are instrumental in shaping and co-creating communication design solutions for underserved international audiences. (Such factors include such as long-term research engagements, in-situ design development, and embracing dialogic and refl exive praxis when designing for local audiences.)},

abstract = {Objective To synthesize findings from the published literature on the use of technology in the NICU to improve communications and interactions among health care providers, parents, and infants. Data Sources Electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for related research published through May 2016. The reference lists of all studies were reviewed, and a hand search of key journals was also conducted to locate eligible studies. Study Selection Eleven studies (five quantitative, two qualitative, and four mixed methods) were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Only studies published in English were included. Data Extraction Whittemore and Knafl's methodology for conducting integrative reviews was used to guide data extraction, analysis, and synthesis. Data were extracted and organized according to the following headings: author, year, and location; study purpose and design; sample size and demographics; technology used; study findings; and limitations. Data Synthesis Various technologies were used, including videoconferencing, videophone, and commercially available modalities such as Skype, FaceTime, AngelEye, and NICView Webcams. In the 11 studies, three main outcomes were evaluated: parents' perception of technology use, health care providers' perceptions of technology use, and objective outcomes, such as parental anxiety or stress or infant length of stay. Overall, parents and health care providers perceived the varied interventions quite favorably, although a few significant differences were found for the objective measures. Conclusion Several interventions have been tested to improve communications and promote interactions among NICU health care team members, parents, and infants. Although initial findings are positive, research in this area is quite limited, and the reviewed studies had several limitations. There is a significant need for further rigorous research to be conducted with diverse samples.},

abstract = {Providing psychosocial support to parents whose infants are hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can improve parents' functioning as well as their relationships with their babies. Yet, few NICUs offer staff education that teaches optimal methods of communication with parents in distress. Limited staff education in how to best provide psychosocial support to families is one factor that may render those who work in the NICU at risk for burnout, compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress syndrome. Staff who develop burnout may have further reduced ability to provide effective support to parents and babies. Recommendations for providing NICU staff with education and support are discussed. The goal is to deliver care that exemplifies the belief that providing psychosocial care and support to the family is equal in importance to providing medical care and developmental support to the baby. RATIONALE The manner in which neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) physicians, nurses and other staff interact with parents greatly influences parents' perceptions long after their baby has been discharged from the NICU. 1 Although attempts are made to educate NICU staff, many feel less than fully prepared to respond to parents' distress, meet their psychosocial needs and interact with them in ways that will enhance their coping both during their NICU stay and postdischarge. 2 Moreover, NICU staff are them-selves at risk for the adverse physical and emotional conse-quences of providing care in one of the hospital's most stressful work areas. If staff are not sufficiently made aware of how to manage their own work stress, the consequences can include burnout, compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress syn-drome and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. Staff may then become emotionally guarded or depleted, and unable to offer supportive care to emotionally vulnerable NICU parents. Burnout syndrome was defined in 1988 as a 'state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by long-term involve-ment in emotionally demanding situations'. 3 Burnout stems primarily from conflict within the work setting, such as unhappi-ness over work conditions, salary or disagreements with co-workers or supervisors. 4 It is reported that as many as 40{\%} of hospital nurses exhibit symptoms of burnout, 5 and rates of burnout by health-care workers (n = 820) reported in one review of 44 NICUs ranged from 7.5 to 54.4{\%}, with rates being higher in non-physicians. 6 Neonatologists are not immune to burnout, though. One study of 110 neonatologists found that 30{\%} experienced high burnout and another 60 to 65{\%} were in the 'at-risk' range. 7 Among the factors associated with burnout in neonatologists are work experience of o 5 years, believing that living with a physical disability is unworthy and having recurrent death ideation.},

A minority use other techniques, such as shadowing patients and observing staff-patient interactions, to find out how and why services work well or not, and how they might be improved. But healthcare staff don't routinely use such data to improve the quality of their services2 3unless they have support.4 Often the patients are only given a passive role with staff making all the decisions about how to respond. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nHere we argue that patients can and should take a more direct and ongoing role in identifying, implementing, and evaluating improvements to healthcare services.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the effect of maternal complications on preterm birth varies between spontaneous and provider-initiated births, as well as among different countries., DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study., SETTING: Twenty-nine countries participating in the World Health Organization Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health., POPULATION: 299 878 singleton deliveries of live neonates or fresh stillbirths., METHODS: Countries were categorised into very high, high, medium and low developed countries using the Human Development Index (HDI) of 2012 by the World Bank. We described the prevalence and risk of maternal complications, their effect on outcomes and their variability by country development., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preterm birth, fresh stillbirth and early neonatal death., RESULTS: The proportion of provider-initiated births among preterm deliveries increased with development: 19{\%} in low to 40{\%} in very high HDI countries. Among preterm deliveries, the socially disadvantaged were less likely, and the medically high risk were more likely, to have a provider-initiated delivery. The effects of anaemia [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.03; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.84; 2.25], chronic hypertension (AOR, 2.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.94; 2.68) and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (AOR, 5.03; 95{\%} CI, 4.72; 5.37) on preterm birth were similar among all four HDI subgroups., CONCLUSIONS: The provision of adequate obstetric care, including optimal timing for delivery in high-risk pregnancies, especially to the socially disadvantaged, could improve pregnancy outcomes. Avoiding preterm delivery in women when maternal complications, such as anaemia or hypertensive disorders, are present is important for countries at various stages of development, but may be more challenging to achieve., Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 RCOG The World Health Organization retains copyright and all other rights in the manuscript of this article as submitted for publication.},

abstract = {Objective: to understand both the maternal experience of the NICU and mothers' views of a NICU Parent Support Group. Background: mothers of babies who are born prematurely have their first experiences of parenting while their infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This presents multiple challenges and a range of stresses related to their role as a mother and concerns about their baby's survival and growth. Thus, various supportive interventions have been trialled with this NICU parent population. However, the focus of this support and how it should be delivered lacks research as an evidence base for practice. Mothers' experiences of the NICU and a professionally facilitated NICU support group at a city hospital were explored in this qualitative research study. Method: nine mothers were interviewed in 2010 while their babies were NICU inpatients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: the NICU admission resulted in participant mothers facing challenges in getting to know their baby, forming their parenting role while in the NICU, and a reliance upon, but resentment toward, nursing staff. Positive feelings about their baby's strengths were also apparent. The parent support group was an important part of managing the experience of the NICU and was reported to meet the emotional support needs of these NICU parents. Conclusion: the implications and recommendations for NICU-based emotional support are discussed. In particular, modifications to support group structures to ensure professional staff involvement and a balance between education and emotional care are reviewed.

abstract = {Preterm birth ({\textless} 37 completed weeks of gestation) is the largest direct cause of neonatal mortality, accounting for an estimated 27{\%} of the 4-million neonatal deaths every year. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a type of care for preterm and premature infants whereby the infant is placed in an upright position against the parent's chest, with early skin-to-skin contact between the parent and infant. Mothers who practise KMC exhibit less maternal stress and fewer symptoms of depression, and have a better sense of the parenting role and more confidence in meeting their babies' needs than those who don't. Despite the apparent feasibility of KMC, currently, only a few preterm babies in low-income countries have access to this intervention. Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of KMC in the community and home setting, and its effects on growth, is still incomplete. Only one study has examined KMC initiation at home. There is an immense need for the promotion of research to improve the delivery of existing cost-effective interventions in low-resource settings and to address key gaps in knowledge. KMC improves growth in low birthweight and preterm infants, and has a significant role to play in protecting them from hypothermia and sepsis, as well as promoting exclusive breastfeeding. KMC helps to reduce neonatal mortality, and inculcates confidence and a better sense of parenting in mothers with regard to their babies' needs.},

A high-level approach to address this chal-lenge is to create a synthesis of emerging solution space that can be used to provide participants with creative and diverse inspirational ideas of others. Existing approaches to generate the synthesis of solution space either require community members to engage in tasks that detract from the main activity of generating ideas or depend on exter-nal crowd workers to help organize the ideas. We built IDEAHOUND a collaborative idea generation system that demonstrates an alternative " organic " human computation approach, where community members (rather than external crowds) contribute feedback about ideas as a byproduct of an activity that naturally integrates into the ideation process. This feedback in turn helps the community identify diverse inspirational ideas that can prompt community members to generate more high-quality and diverse ideas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). We critically engage with CHI communities emerging outside the global North (ArabHCI and AfriCHI) to explore how participation is configured and enacted within sociocultural and political contexts fundamentally different from Western societies. We contribute to recent discussions about postcolonialism and decolonization of HCI by focusing on non-Western future technology designers. Our lens was a course designed to engage Egyptian students with a local yet culturally-distant community to design applications for documenting intangible heritage. Through an action research, the instructors reflect on selected students' activities. Despite deploying a flexible learning curriculum that encourages greater autonomy, the students perceived themselves with less agency than other institutional stakeholders involved in the project. Further, some of them struggled to empathize with the community as the impact of the cultural differences on configuring participation was profound. We discuss the implications of the findings on HCI education and in international cross-cultural design projects.},

At term equivalent, mothers completed the Parental Stressor Scale: NICU and were interviewed about their psychological well-being and family circumstances. Infant clinical data were also collected. At corrected age 4 years, 49 children were assessed for cognition, language and socio-emotional development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Mothers reported moderate to low stress, with parental role alteration considered most stressful and parent-staff communications least stressful. Predictors of overall stress included maternal educational underachievement, stressful life events, postnatal depression and infant unsettled-irregular behavior.

abstract = {Effective presentation of data for decision support is a major issue when large volumes of data are generated as happens in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Although the most common approach is to present the data graphically, it has been shown that textual summarisation can lead to improved decision making. As part of the BabyTalk project, we present a prototype, called BT-45, which generates textual summaries of about 45 minutes of continuous physiological signals and discrete events (e.g.: equipment settings and drug administration). Its architecture brings together techniques from the different areas of signal processing, medical reasoning, knowledge engineering, and natural language generation. A clinical off-ward experiment in a Neonatal ICU (NICU) showed that human expert textual descriptions of NICU data lead to better decision making than classical graphical visualisation, whereas texts generated by BT-45 lead to similar quality decision-making as visualisations. Textual analysis showed that BT-45 texts were inferior to human expert texts in a number of ways, including not reporting temporal information as well and not producing good narratives. Despite these deficiencies, our work shows that it is possible for computer systems to generate effective textual summaries of complex continuous and discrete temporal clinical data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present a defense of the use of single case studies in management research. The defense is necessary because this type of research has been relegated to a secondary role, or even rejected, by many researchers, who consider it unscientific. Evidence of this low status is the fact that most reputable academic journals in management publish few articles based on single-case studies. In this paper, we examine in detail the objections to the use of such cases in management research. We show the efforts made by some researchers to answer these objections and we show quality criteria for research that are alternatives to the criteria used in the so-called "scientific method." Our analysis suggests that a better understanding - by researchers with different methodological preferences - of the arguments for each particular use of the single-case study as a research method would allow a better dialogue between researchers and benefit management research as a whole.},

In my own areas of research -- human-computer interaction and computer- supported co-operative work, it has transformed thinking about the role of users in the software development process. However, participatory design refers to a high-level feature of design methods that can be implemented in myriad ways. It is not a single and integral design method. In this paper, I discuss several dimensions of possible implementations of participatory design: domains of human activity — roles of stakeholders in a design, types of shared design representations, the scope and duration of participatory interactions, and the relationship of users to design activity with respect to changes in their knowledge and skill. I believe these dimensions},

abstract = {When engaged in ICTD research, it is often simpler to focus efforts on a single specific technology, whether that entails computers for telecenters, mobile phones for data collection, or text messages for public health education. In practice, however, people and organizations use a variety of technologies together, smoothly interweaving them as they navigate their lives. In this paper we analyze the ways in which a health financing organization in Uganda integrates a variety of communications technologies together to achieve reliable communications with their partnering health facilities distributed throughout Southwest Uganda. Based on four years of participant observation, we describe two communication scenarios in this organization to illustrate braided communications at work. We find that stakeholders work together to develop and maintain effective relationships using many different communications channels together in parallel, a combined channel we describe as braided communications. Braided communications have three primary characteristics. Firstly, they use co-existing channels, employing each as best suits a given set of goals. Secondly, they are co-dependent, or co-reinforcing, with strengths of individual channels reinforcing weaknesses of other channels. Finally, they are co-evolving; as available technologies and the ways in which they are used change, the nature of the braided use changes as well. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has served to significantly reduce the mortality of HIV-infected persons. However, this treatment is associated with a host of adverse effects: fatigue, nausea, pain, anxiety and depression. Rather than utilise traditional pharmacological treatments for these effects, many HIV/AIDS patients are utilising adjunct therapies to maintain their quality of life while they undergo treatment. Exercise has consistently been listed as one of the most popular self-care therapies and a small number of studies have been conducted to examine the impact of exercise on the most common self-reported symptoms of HIV and AIDS and the adverse effects of treatment. Although the results are generally positive, there are clear limitations to this work. The existing studies have utilised small samples and experienced high rates of attrition. In addition, the majority of the studies were conducted prior to the widespread use of HAART, which limits the ability to generalise these data. As a result, data from other chronic disease and healthy samples are used to suggest that exercise has the potential to be a beneficial treatment across the range of symptoms and adverse effects experienced by HIV-infected individuals. However, additional research is required with this population to demonstrate these effects.},

However, community and health worker perceptions on optimal mobile phone communication for PMTCT are underexplored. This study examined what specific content and forms of mobile communication are acceptable to support PMTCT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Qualitative methods using focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted in two district hospitals in Nyanza Province, Kenya. A total of 45 participants were purposefully selected, including HIV-positive women enrolled in PMTCT, their male partners, community health workers, and nurses. Semi-structured discussion guides were used to elicit participants' current mobile phone uses for PMTCT and their perceived benefits and challenges. We also examined participants' views on platform design and gender-tailored short message service (SMS) messages designed to improve PMTCT communication and male involvement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Most participants had access to a mobile phone and prior experience receiving and sending SMS, although phone sharing was common among couples. Mobile phones were used for several health-related purposes, primarily as voice calls rather than texts. The perceived benefits of mobile phones for PMTCT included linking with health workers, protecting confidentiality, and receiving information and reminders. Men and women considered the gender-tailored SMS as a catalyst for improving PMTCT male involvement and couples' communication. However, informative messaging relayed safely to the intended recipient was critical. In addition, health workers emphasized the continual need for in-person counseling coupled with, rather than replaced by, mobile phone reinforcement. For all participants, integrated and neutral text messaging provided antenatally and postnatally was most preferred, although not all topics or text formats were equally acceptable.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Given the ubiquity of mobile phones in Kenya and current health-related uses of mobile phones, a PMTCT mobile communications platform holds considerable potential. This pre-intervention assessment of community and health worker preferences yielded valuable information on the complexities of design and implementation. An effective PMTCT mobile platform engaging men and women will need to address contexts of non-disclosure, phone sharing, and linkages with existing community and facility-based services.},

abstract = {The field of Participatory Design (PD) has greatly diversified and we see a broad spectrum of approaches and methodologies emerging. However, to foster its role in designing future interactive technologies, a discussion about accountability and rigour across this spectrum is needed. Rejecting the traditional, positivistic framework, we take inspiration from related fields such as Design Research and Action Research to develop interpretations of these concepts that are rooted in PDs own belief system. We argue that unlike in other fields, accountability and rigour are nuanced concepts that are delivered through debate, critique and reflection. A key prerequisite for having such debates is the availability of a language that allows designers, researchers and practitioners to construct solid arguments about the appropriateness of their stances, choices and judgements. To this end, we propose a "tool-to-think-with" that provides such a language by guiding designers, researchers and practitioners through a process of systematic reflection and critical analysis. The tool proposes four lenses to critically reflect on the nature of a PD effort: epistemology, values, stakeholders and outcomes. In a subsequent step, the coherence between the revealed features is analysed and shows whether they pull the project in the same direction or work against each other. Regardless of the flavour of PD, we argue that this coherence of features indicates the level of internal rigour of PD work and that the process of reflection and analysis provides the language to argue for it. We envision our tool to be useful at all stages of PD work: in the planning phase, as part of a reflective practice during the work, and as a means to construct knowledge and advance the field after the fact. We ground our theoretical discussions in a specific PD experience, the ECHOES project, to motivate the tool and to illustrate its workings.},

abstract = {Novice qualitative researchers are often unsure regarding the analysis of their data and, where grounded theory is chosen, they may be uncertain regarding the differences that now exist between the approaches of Glaser and Strauss, who together first described the method. These two approaches are compared in relation to roots and divergences, role of induction, deduction and verification, ways in which data are coded and the format of generated theory. Personal experience of developing as a ground theorist is used to illustrate some of the key differences. A conclusion is drawn that, rather than debate relative merits of the two approaches, suggests that novice researchers need to select the method that best suits their cognitive style and develop analytic skills through doing research. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An inductive, multi-case analysis was conducted to examine how design practices involving physicians and medical device developers influence outcomes in early stage medical device companies. This research was motivated by an interest in understanding the role of users in the device development process, specifically in terms of how user interaction influences the acceptance or rejection of new products. To examine this area, an analytic framework for case-based research was first developed, based on exploratory interviews with leaders in the medical device field. Retrospective case studies were then conducted on eight entrepreneurial firms (four rival pairs) in the areas of pulse oximetry, robotic surgery, cardiac bypass surgery, and minimally invasive spine surgery. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, the study showed that product adoption relied on maximizing benefits for product stakeholders, while minimizing required changes in physician behavior. The data further illustrated that total benefit to product stakeholders was influenced to the greatest degree by benefits afforded to hospitals and physicians, assuming patient benefit was greater than or equal to the standard of care. This study highlights the importance of identifying the often-conflicting needs of medical device stakeholders, and then optimizing devices to satisfy the needs of those with the greatest influence over product use and adoption.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify microbial contamination of human milk purchased via the Internet as an indicator of disease risk to recipient infants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cross-sectional sample of human milk purchased via a popular US milk-sharing Web site (2012). Individuals advertising milk were contacted to arrange purchase, and milk was shipped to a rented mailbox in Ohio. The Internet milk samples (n = 101) were compared with unpasteurized samples of milk donated to a milk bank (n = 20).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Most (74{\%}) Internet milk samples were colonized with Gram-negative bacteria or had {\textgreater}10(4) colony-forming units/mL total aerobic count. They exhibited higher mean total aerobic, total Gram-negative, coliform, and Staphylococcus sp counts than milk bank samples. Growth of most species was positively associated with days in transit (total aerobic count [log10 colony-forming units/mL] $\beta$ = 0.71 [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.38-1.05]), and negatively associated with number of months since the milk was expressed ($\beta$ = -0.36 [95{\%} confidence interval: -0.55 to -0.16]), per simple linear regression. No samples were HIV type 1 RNA-positive; 21{\%} of Internet samples were cytomegalovirus DNA-positive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Human milk purchased via the Internet exhibited high overall bacterial growth and frequent contamination with pathogenic bacteria, reflecting poor collection, storage, or shipping practices. Infants consuming this milk are at risk for negative outcomes, particularly if born preterm or are medically compromised. Increased use of lactation support services may begin to address the milk supply gap for women who want to feed their child human milk but cannot meet his or her needs.},

abstract = {ontext: Co-creation—collaborative knowledge generation by academics working alongside other stakeholders—reflects a “Mode 2” relationship (knowl-edge production rather than knowledge translation) between universities and society. Co-creation is widely believed to increase research impact. Methods: We undertook a narrative review of different models of co-creation relevant to community-based health services. We contrasted their diverse dis-ciplinary roots and highlighted their common philosophical assumptions, principles of success, and explanations for failures. We applied these to an empirical case study of a community-based research-service partnership led by The Milbank Quarterly, Vol. 94, No. 2, 2016 (pp. 392-429) c 2016 The Author(s).

Findings: Co-creation emerged independently in several fields, including busi-ness studies (“value co-creation”), design science (“experience-based co-design”), computer science (“technology co-design”), and community development (“par-ticipatory research”). These diverse models share some common features, which were also evident in the case study. Key success principles included (1) a sys-tems perspective (assuming emergence, local adaptation, and nonlinearity); (2) the framing of research as a creative enterprise with human experience at its core; and (3) an emphasis on process (the framing of the program, the nature of relationships, and governance and facilitation arrangements, especially the style of leadership and how conflict is managed). In both the literature re-view and the case study, co-creation “failures” could often be tracked back to abandoning (or never adopting) these principles. All co-creation models made strong claims for significant and sustainable societal impacts as a result of the adaptive and developmental research process; these were illustrated in the case study. Conclusions: Co-creation models have high potential for societal impact but depend critically on key success principles. To capture the nonlinear chains of causation in the co-creation pathway, impact metrics must reflect the dynamic nature and complex interdependencies of health research systems and add},

abstract = {Empirical methods used for studying design thinking have included verbal protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have looked at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment, experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled, aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical DOE and analysis methods such as ANOVA. Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and novices, identifying and overcoming fixation, role of analogies, effectiveness of ideation methods, and other various tools. A variety of data may be collected, related to both the process and the outcome (designs).There are still no standards for designing, collecting and analyzing data, partly due to the lack of cognitive models and theories of design thinking. Data analysis is tedious and the rate of discoveries has been slow. Future studies may need to develop computer based data collection and automated analyses, which may facilitate collection of massive amounts of data with the potential of rapid advancement of the rate of discoveries and development of cognitive models of design thinking.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Parents whose infants are being treated in the NICU are at high risk for depression and anxiety, with negative implications for parenting and infant development. OBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of NICU-based interventions to reduce maternal depressive or anxiety symptoms. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, Cochrane, and CINAHL were searched for relevant studies. Reference lists from selected studies were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled design, a parent-focused intervention delivered in the NICU, valid maternal depressive or anxiety symptom measures at pre- and postintervention, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 coders. RESULTS Twelve studies met inclusion criteria for qualitative review; 2 were excluded from quantitative analyses for high risk of bias. Fixed- and random-effects models, with 7 eligible studies assessing depressive symptoms, indicated an effect of -0.16 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.32 to -0.002;P{\textless} .05) and, with 8 studies assessing anxiety symptoms, indicated an effect of -0.12 (95{\%} CI, -0.29 to 0.05;P= .17). The subset of interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms (effect, -0.44; 95{\%} CI, -0.77 to -0.11;P= .01). LIMITATIONS The small number and methodological shortcomings of studies limit conclusions regarding intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS Combined intervention effects significantly reduced maternal depressive but not anxiety symptoms. The evidence is strongest for the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions on maternal depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {Traditional medicines are an integral part of health care worldwide, even though their efficacy has not been scientifically proven. HIV-infected individuals may use them singularly or in combination with conventional medicines. Many in vitro studies have proven the anti-HIV, anti-Candida, and anti-herpes simplex virus potential of traditional plants and identified some of the mechanisms of action. Very few in vivo studies are available that involve a small number of participants and show controversial results. In addition, knowledge is limited of the role of traditional medicines in the enhancement of the immune system. The use of traditional medicines with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has created a problem because drug interactions compromise the efficacy of ARVs. Several currently popular plants have been studied in the laboratory for their interaction with ARVs, with disadvantageous results. Unfortunately, no clinical trials are available. The science of traditional medicines is relatively new and is at present being modernized worldwide. However, there are still ethical issues regarding traditional medicines that need to be addressed-for example, regulations regarding quality control and standardization of medicines, regulation and education of healers who deliver these medicines, and unregulated clinical trials. The workshop addressed the following questions about traditional medicine and their use in HIV infection: What are the mechanisms of action of anti-HIV traditional medicines? Should traditional medicines be used in conjunction with ARV? Do traditional medicines enhance the immune system? Should medicinal plants be used for the control of oral infections associated with HIV? What are the ethical issues surrounding the use of traditional medicines for the treatment of HIV and associated infections?},

We illustrate this with a concrete research study in which we applied this method to investigate 'the need to stay in touch' present in different families. Firstly we discuss the problems that emerge when applying this method to a family as opposed to applying it to individuals. Secondly we discuss the design of the package, illustrated with examples, and finally we discuss the translation of the qualitative data into visualised contextual scenarios. We conclude with a reflection on how the research has affected our awareness of the design context.},

abstract = {The literature on African and Asian truck drivers is reviewed, revealing only 3 ethnographically-oriented studies of driver sexual cultures: Nigeria, Zimbabwe and India. Aspects of driver sexual cultures are gleaned from other sources for Kenya and Thailand and a picture of rather monolithic sexual cultures exists for Nigeria, where drivers have multiple regular partners at any one time, and India, where most drivers have multiple commercial partners at short intervals. Sexual cultures of Zimbabwean, Kenyan and Thai drivers may be more heterogeneous: larger numbers claim to be abstinent on the road; some have regular extramarital girlfriends; some occasionally, and some regularly, avail themselves of sex workers. As with other men in high-HIV areas, the main risk- reduction interventions attempted with drivers are: increasing sexual health-seeking behaviour, increasing condom use and reducing partner numbers. Only 4 such programmes are well reported in the literature, in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya and India, and only the last 3 have reported on evaluation components. While drivers increase their sexual health-seeking behaviour if clinics become convenient to them on the road, and increase condom use, it is not clear that many of them are reducing partner numbers. It is suggested that partner reduction may be difficult to achieve in Nigeria and India. In Zimbabwe and Kenya some drivers continue in high-risk behaviour and reasons for their resistance to change are discussed. In India, free roadside tea parlours with STD clinics have been established; these have increased sexual health-seeking behaviour and condom use, and insulate drivers from sex workers.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify smartphone menstrual cycle tracking applications (apps) and evaluate their accuracy, features, and functionality. METHODS In this systematic evaluation, we searched the Apple iTunes store for free menstrual cycle tracking apps for patient use. We considered an application accurate if menstrual cycle predictions were based on average cycle lengths of at least three previous cycles, ovulation (when included) was predicted at 13-15 days before the start of the next cycle, and the application contained no misinformation. We modified the APPLICATIONS Scoring System to evaluate the features and functionality of accurate apps. RESULTS Our search criteria yielded 1,116 apps; 108 remained after excluding duplicate, non-English, nonmenstrual cycle tracking, and priced apps. We further eliminated 88 that did not meet inclusion or accuracy criteria. Of the 20 accurate, free apps, 80{\%} contained information for conception and 50{\%} for contraception. Common features and functionality included password protection (55{\%}); no requirement for Internet connectivity (80{\%}); no advertisements (65{\%}); in-application technical support (70{\%}); medical disclaimers (65{\%}); health education (55{\%}); tracking of menstrual flow (70{\%}), symptoms (70{\%}), and intercourse (75{\%}); alerts for next menses (65{\%}) and fertility (55{\%}); and cycle length information (75{\%}). Forty percent were available for Android. Usefulness for fertility medications (15{\%}), professional involvement (5{\%}), and cited literature (5{\%}) were rare. CONCLUSION Most free smartphone menstrual cycle tracking apps for patient use are inaccurate. Few cite medical literature or health professional involvement. We list accurate apps to aid health care providers in understanding the key components they can use to evaluate and recommend apps for patients.},

Most neonatal deaths occur at home in low-income and middle-income countries against a backdrop of poverty, sub-optimum care seeking, and weak health systems. 1–4 Globally, neonatal deaths now account for 38{\%} of deaths in children aged younger than 5 years. 2 Child survival and safe motherhood strategies have yet to adequately address mortality in the neonatal period. A major barrier to action on neonatal health has been the erroneous perception that only expensive, high-level technology and facility-based care can reduce mortality. 5,6},

This article opens up factors that influence the success of co-design activities in the development of services among cross-disciplinary networks. It presents the findings from follow-up interviews assessing the impacts of six service co-design projects realised by a university with partners from healthcare, education and technology. The focus is on the barriers and enablers of co-design that the participants had encountered. The central findings are that a university-led service co-design project remains a superimposed activity with low impact on actual design decisions or core activities in the client organisations and that the utilisation of co-design greatly relies on individual, committed participants. Based on the empirical material, 20 barrier-enabler couples related to collaboration, the organisation, processes, implementation and methods are identified and described, the consideration of which can lead to more impactful service co-design practice.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. This article explores how power dynamics between informants and field researchers shape ethnographic data construction, drawing on fieldwork at a pharmaceutical company. Pharmaceutical companies are considered elite settings, and often assumed to be powerful in relation to the researcher and dominating the data construction. However, such a view conceptualizes power in terms of fixed categories, in which there is a superior and subordinate position. We reconsider the impact of elite informants in the light of a constructivist, interactionist view on power, in which power is dynamic and not necessarily entailing domination. We answer the following research questions: (1) How can we observe power dynamics, as conceptualized in a constructionist and interaction orientation, in ethnographic research? and (2) How can we reflect on what these power dynamics mean for data construction, based on our experiences in elite settings? To do so, we make use of discursive and interactional analytic methods and propose three levels of analysis: (1) the level of conversation, (2) the level of ethnography, and (3) the level of the organization in society. They respectively shed light on power in relation to (1) what is said and how, (2) the meanings attached to the ethnographic events, and (3) the meaning of the ethnography in relation to the discourses on the organization in society.

@article{Howard2014,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore how participatory prototyping, through the use of design charrettes, can advance participatory action research (PAR) approaches and contribute to codesign practices in organisational settings. This will be achieved through the comparison of two varying design charrette experiences from a PAR initiative to redesign spaces in the Auraria Library in Denver, Colorado. Each design charrette followed a three-stage sequence of information sharing, idea generation and prototyping, and prioritisation with each stage building upon the former, both in terms of design concepts and in building up elements of ‘making'. While both charrette structures were similar, leadership and execution varied considerably. Lessons learned from the two design charrette experiences are presented, including the value of participatory prototyping within PAR to support ‘research through design' activities. In addition, it highlights the value of authentic design participation of ‘designing with' rather than ‘designing for' to encourage optimal design outcomes.},

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of user requirements in care settings poses interesting methodological challenges. This paper details some methodological options for developing technologies which allow end-user composition and re-configurability, and documents how fieldwork has been translated into design solutions. In particular we describe the notion of technological assemblies interpreted as the combination of services and devices, which the users can dynamically configure to support their needs. We report on the importance of flexibility and control in the use of such technological assemblies in a neonatal ward and present an early prototype of incubator designed to be sensitive to the particular requirements of the setting},

@article{Hetrick2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective treatment of depression in young people is critical, given its prevalence, impacts, and link to suicide. Clinical practice guidelines point to the need for regular monitoring of depression symptom severity and the emergence of suicidal ideation to track treatment progress and guide intervention delivery. Yet, this is seldom integrated in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to address the gap between guidelines about monitoring and real-world practice by codesigning an app with young people that allows for self-monitoring of mood and communication of this monitoring with a clinician. METHODS: We engaged young people aged 18 to 25 years who had experienced depression, suicidal ideation including those who self-harm, as well as clinicians in a codesign process. We used a human-centered codesign design studio methodology where young people designed the features of the app first individually and then as a group. This resulted in a minimal viable product design, represented through low-fidelity hand-drawn wireframes. Clinicians were engaged throughout the process via focus groups. RESULTS: The app incorporated a mood monitoring feature with innovative design aspects that allowed customization, and was named a "well-being tracker" in response to the need for a positive approach to this function. Brief personalized interventions designed to support young people in the intervals between face-to-face appointments were embedded in the app and were immediately available via pop-ups generated by a back-end algorithm within the well-being tracker. Issues regarding the safe incorporation of alerts generated by the app into face-to-face clinical services were raised by clinicians (ie, responding in a timely manner) and will need to be addressed during the full implementation of the app into clinical services. CONCLUSIONS: The potential to improve outcomes for young people via technology-based enhancement to interventions is enormous. Enhancing communication between young people and their clinicians about symptoms and treatment progress and increasing access to timely and evidence-based interventions are desirable outcomes. To achieve positive outcomes for young people using technology- (app) based interventions, it is critical to understand and incorporate, in a meaningful way, the expectations and motivations of both young people and clinicians.},

The study shows that it can be rewarding to do participatory design projects with marginalized children and prosthetists in developing countries. However, for such projects to be successful, designers and organizations in charge of product development must understand that they will be working under different circumstances than when doing participatory design in developed countries. We identify and describe examples of differentiating circumstances across four categories: human; social, cultural and religious; financial and timeframe; and organizational. The field research illustrates that an important advantage of using participatory design with marginalized people in developing countries is the opportunity to develop empowering outcomes of two types: products that meet the users' needs as well as psychological empowerment of the participants. We propose a pyramid model of empowering outcomes that is based on Zimmerman's (1995) model of psychological empowerment. Based on integrating this notion of psychological empowerment, we present an alternative framework for deploying participatory design in developing countries as it has served us in the Cambodia case.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transfer to the neonate may contribute to improve dietary support for infants born prematurely to mothers with placental lipid transport disorders. OBJECTIVE: We studied whether DHA supplements modify the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of placental lipid transport proteins to allow a selective transfer of DHA to the fetus. DESIGN: Healthy pregnant women (n = 136) received, in a double-blind randomized trial, 500 mg DHA + 150 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 400 microg 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid, 500 mg DHA + 400 microg 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid, or placebo during the second half of gestation. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of maternal and cord blood phospholipids and of placenta; we quantified placental mRNA expression of fatty acid-transport protein 1 (FATP-1), FATP-4, FATP-6, fatty acid translocase, fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) plasma membrane, heart-FABP, adipocyte-FABP, and brain-FABP. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of the lipid carriers assayed did not differ significantly between the 4 groups. However, the mRNA expression of FATP-1 and FATP-4 in placenta was correlated with DHA in both maternal plasma and placental phospholipids, although only FATP-4 expression was significantly correlated with DHA in cord blood phospholipids. Additionally, the mRNA expression of several membrane lipid carriers was correlated with EPA and DHA in placental triacylglycerols and with EPA in placental free fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of the mRNA expression of the membrane placental proteins FATP-1 and especially of FATP-4 with maternal and cord DHA leads us to conclude that these lipid carriers are involved in placental transfer of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids},

abstract = {There has been increasing awareness over recent years of the persisting burden of worldwide maternal, newborn, and child mortality. The majority of maternal deaths occur during labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period, with obstetric hemorrhage as the primary medical cause of death. Other causes of maternal mortality include hypertensive diseases, sepsis/infections, obstructed labor, and abortion-related complications. Recent estimates indicate that in 2009 an estimated 3.3 million babies died in the first month of life and that overall, 7.3 million children under 5 die each year. Recent data also suggest that sufficient evidence- and consensus-based interventions exist to address reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health globally, and if implemented at scale, these have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need to put elements in place to promote integrated interventions among healthcare professionals and their associations.

abstract = {Contemporary design practices, such as participatory design (PD), human-centered design (HCD), and codesign, have inherent ethical qualities, which often remain implicit and unexamined. Three design projects in the high-tech industry were studied using three ethical traditions as lenses. Virtue ethics helped to understand cooperation, curiosity, creativity, and empowerment as virtues that people in PD need to cultivate, so that they can engage, for example, in mutual learning and collaborative prototyping. Ethics of alterity (Levinas and Derrida) helped to understand human-centered design as a fragile encounter between project team members and prospective users, and foregrounds the ethics in these encounters: our tendencies to “grasp the other” and to “program invention.” And pragmatist ethics (Dewey) helped to understand codesign as a process of joint inquiry and imagination, involving the organization of iterative processes of problem setting and solution finding, with moral qualities. When we open the “black boxes” of design practices, we find them filled with ethics. Moreover, it is proposed that design practitioners need to make explicit their practices' inherent ethical qualities and that they can do that by embracing reflexivity.},

@article{Rostami2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family-centered care (FCC) involves holistic care and requires cooperation with the family in planning, intervention, and the evolution of the care that is being provided. Many previous studies have provided results that indicate the importance of the family's involvement in pediatric care, but there is still resistance in doing so within the organizational culture of the hospitals in Iran. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of FCC on the satisfaction of parents of children hospitalized in 2012 in the pediatric ward at Razi Hospital in Chaloos, Iran. METHODS: This Quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2012 in the pediatric ward at Razi Hospital in Chaloos, Iran. Seventy hospitalized children between the ages of 1 and 3 who suffered from diarrhea, vomiting, or pneumonia were selected through convenience sampling. They were divided randomly into two equal groups, a control group (routine care) and an experimental group (family-centered care). SPSS Statistics 14 software was used to analyze the data, and p{\textless}0.05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS: In the FCC group, the mean score of satisfaction among the parents of the children was 20 out of 90 before the intervention, but, after the FCC method was used, it increased to 83.2 out of 90. In addition, a significant difference was found between the scores of satisfaction for the control and experimental groups (p{\textless}0.001), and all parents of children in the experimental group expressed high satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the practice of FCC in caring for the sick children can increase the satisfaction of their parents significantly. The role of the family's involvement is critical in every component of the intervention efforts, as shown by the constructs of participatory support, educational support, and psychological support. Thus, a notable implication here is that FCC may lead to increased quality of care and should be included in the educational programs of the nursing staff in pediatric ward.},

abstract = {This article highlights the significance of a methodology that includes the emotions as an integral element in the construction and analysis of data. The research question is: how can an emotional self-awareness of the researcher on data contribute towards understanding and knowledge. The objective is to display how reflections on the emotions of the researchers provide increased depth of the construction of the data and the topic studied. The empirical data have been obtained from two PhD projects on child and family contact with child protection authorities in Norway. The sampled material derives from situations in the interviews that particularly affected us emotionally and which we reflected on several years after the interviews took place. Through a re-analysis of the interview process, we display how the researchers constructed the data and how we, in the original research, overlooked important questions. Our analytical approach in the original project as in this re-analysis is constructivist interactionism. For the re-analysis, we both draw on the epistemology of emotion and the concept ‘account'. The article contributes to the development of methods by demonstrating how analysis might be made more reflective and transpar- ent by taking the emotions of the researcher into account. The implication for practice is that we recommend a ‘re-consideration' of data when one is emotionally aroused, and also to engage associates in the analysis},

abstract = {In the context of the rapid growth of mobile phone penetration in developing countries, mobile telephony is currently considered to be particularly important for development. Yet, until recently, very little systematic evidence was available that shed light on the developmental impacts of mobile telecommunication. The Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada, has played a critical role in filling some of the research gaps through its partnerships with several key actors in this area. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the case of mobile phones as a tool in solving development problems drawing from the evidence of IDRC supported projects. IDRC has supported around 20 projects that cut across several themes such as livelihoods, poverty reduction, health, education, the environment and disasters. The projects will be analyzed by theme in order to provide a thematic overview as well as a comparative analysis of the development role of mobile phones. In exploring the evidence from completed projects as well as the foci of new projects, the paper summarizes and critically assesses the key findings and suggests possible avenues for future research. 1. INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of mobile phone networks in developing countries. Most of the countries in the developing world have skipped fixed-line infrastructure and leapfrogged directly into mobile technology. Currently mobile telephony is the predominant mode of communication in the developing world. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the average number of mobile phones per 100 inhabitants in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has risen by 100-400{\%} in a span of just five years (Orbicom, 2007). In 1995, there were more phone lines in Manhattan than in all of Sub-Saharan Africa. Now almost one in five Africans owns a phone. More people in India and China own mobile phones than in North America and Europe combined. While developing countries are still lagging behind high-income countries in overall ICT usage and applications, the mobile phone has been regarded as a more accessible and less expensive means to close the digital divide (Wade 2004). There are several reasons why mobile phones are considered as particularly important for development. First, beyond basic connectivity, mobile phones offer benefits such as mobility and security to owners (Donner, 2006). Second, due to their unique characteristics, the mobile phone is an especially good leapfrogger: it works using the radio spectrum, as such there is no need to rely on physical infrastructure such as roads and phone wires, and base-stations can be powered using their own generators in places where there is no electrical grid (Economist, 2008). Third, mobile phones only require basic literacy, and therefore are accessible to a large segment of the population. Fourth, mobiles enjoy some technical advantages that make them particularly attractive for development. In addition to voice communication, mobile phones allow for the transfer of data, which can be used in the context of applications for the purposes of health, education, commerce or governance.},

abstract = {Little sociological research has sought to investigate the ways in which women with hospitalized newborn infants construct and practice motherhood. This article seeks to address this lacuna, using data from a qualitative research project based in two Australian neonatal nurseries. Thirty-one mothers of hospitalized newborns and 20 neonatal nurses were interviewed, and other data were obtained via observations of the nurseries, tape-recorded verbal interactions between parents and nursery staff and casual conversations with mothers and nurses. The data revealed that while the mothers' and nurses' discourses on what makes a 'good mother' in the context of the neonatal nursery converged to some extent, there were important differences. The mothers particularly emphasized the importance of physical contact with their infants and breastfeeding, while the nurses privileged presence in the nursery and willingness to learn about the infant's condition and treatment. There was evidence of power struggles between the mothers and nurses over the handling and treatment of the infants, which had implications for how the mothers constructed and practised motherhood. The mothers attempted to construct themselves as 'real mothers', which involved establishing connection with their infants and normalizing them. In time, many of the mothers sought to position themselves as the 'experts' on their infants. For their part, the nurses attempted to position themselves as 'teachers and monitors of the parents', 'protectors of the infants' and 'experts' by virtue of their medical training and experience. Differences in defining the situation resulted in frustration, resentment and anger on the part of the mothers and disciplinary and surveillance actions on the part of many of the nurses, both covert and overt. The nurses' attitude to and treatment of the mothers was integral in the development of the mothers' relationship with their infants in the nurseries, and this influence extended beyond discharge of the infants.

Nurses (n = 124) indicated on the 55-item Family-Centered Care Questionnaire (FCCQ) whether the activity was necessary for family-centered care and was currently a part of their practice. Content validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency were good. The nurses perceived that they performed all elements significantly less in their current practice than they believed necessary. Their perceptions about the necessary components and their practices of family-centered care varied with their age and clinical position. Although nurses indicated knowledge of family-centered care, they reported that they did not incorporate this knowledge into their practice. Several issues, such as nurses' ability to practice family-centered care, the support of the hospital infrastructure provided for nurses to practice family-centered care, and nurses' perceptions of their role in caring for families, help to explain the findings.},

abstract = {The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) tools to improve the efficiency of professionalism at work is increasing every time under the dynamic digital environment. Tools such as telemedicine, tele-education, and health informatics have of late been incorporated in the health sector to enable easy access to essential services, for example, in medical areas from referral centers by the patients on one hand and enabling the doctor to doctor consultations for the benefit of patients. Unfortunately, observations indicate dearth efforts and commitment to optimize use of the tools in the majority of the countries south of the Sahara. Sub-Saharan Africa has been left almost behind the rest of the world in terms of development going through decades of economic exploitation by especially the west through its natural and human resources. These factors, ethnic conflicts and endless wars have continued to ruin sub-Saharan Africa's socio-economic development. Information was obtained through a network of telemedicine practitioners in different African countries using internet communication, through E-mail and reviewing existing literature of their activities. This information was compiled from representative countries in each African region and the previous authors'experiences as telemedicine practioners. Most of these countries have inadequate ICT infrastructure, which yet creates sub-optimal application. Sub-Saharan Africa, made up of 33 of the 48 global poorest countries has to extend its ICT diffusion and policy to match the ever developing global economy. In some countries such as Ethiopia and South Africa there is significant progress in Telemedicine while in countries such as Burkina Faso and Nigeria the progress is slow because of lack of political support. Almost all reference to Africa is made in due respect to sub-Saharan Africa, one with big social, economic, and political problems with resultant high morbidity and mortality rates. This also highlights the under-representation of African researchers in the global whelm of information system research. Telemedicine in Africa though has not attracted enough political support is potentially a very useful conduit of health-care given the fact that the continent is resource limited and still enduring the effects of scarce human resource especially in health.},

abstract = {The British National Health Service (NHS) has been involved in profound transformation to keep pace with, and shape, changes in our society. Innovation has been driven by the necessity to transform old hierarchical and paternalistic models into a modern health system, moving care closer to home, mobilizing and tailoring services to individual patients' and their carers' needs through the introduction of radically new services. This paper explores a particular element of ongoing NHS reform: Practice Based Commissioning (PBC). Based on first findings of a research project called “Design in Practice. Change and Flexibility within Health Providers” funded by the EPSRC research centre HACIRIC, the authors argue that PBC formally recognizes important forms of grassroots service design, but also introduces additional challenges. The project is based on case studies within the North West Strategic Health Area (UK), and the study of PBC frameworks and everyday PBC practices in this specific context is explored and contrasted with concurrent efforts to bring service design into the public sector, which are focusing on co-design and experience-based design methodologies. It is suggested that these have the potential to help NHS providers address NHS policy demands to use patient feedback in transforming services (DH, 2009), and the authors reflect on possibilities for potentiation through the application of Service Design methods in this context.},

abstract = {Introduction. Information and communication technology (ICT) are becoming a natural part in healthcare both for delivering and giving accessibility to healthcare for people with chronic illness living at home. Aim. The aim was to review existing studies describing the use of ICT in home care for communication between patients, family members, and healthcare professionals. Methods. A review of studies was conducted that identified 1,276 studies. A selection process and quality appraisal were conducted, which finally resulted in 107 studies. Results. The general results offer an overview of characteristics of studies describing the use of ICT applications in home care and are summarized in areas including study approach, quality appraisal, publications data, terminology used for defining the technology, and disease diagnosis. The specific results describe how communication with ICT was performed in home care and the benefits and drawbacks with the use of ICT. Results were predominated by positive responses in the use of ICT. Conclusion. The use of ICT applications in home care is an expanding research area, with a variety of ICT tools used that could increase accessibility to home care. Using ICT can lead to people living with chronic illnesses gaining control of their illness that promotes self-care.},

abstract = {Nursing staff are an important source of support for parents of a hospitalized preterm infant. This study aimed to describe parents' and nurses' perceptions of communicating with each other in the context of the special care nursery. Method: A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Thirty two parents with a newborn admitted to one of two special care nurseries in Queensland, Australia participated, and 12 nurses participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interviews. Results: Nurses and parents focused on similar topics, but their perceptions differed. Provision of information and enabling parenting were central to effective communication, supported by an appropriate interpersonal style by nurses. Parents described difficulties accessing or engaging nurses. Managing enforcement of policies was a specific area of difficulty for both parents and nurses. Conclusion: The findings indicated a tension between providing family-centered care that is individualized and based on family needs and roles, and adhering to systemic nursery policies.},

abstract = {Computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are limited in developing countries because of their expense and requirement for additional equipment, such as relatively complex network connections. Cell phones, which are ubiquitous and cheaper than most computers and PDAs, offer a simple solution to a paper-based system. This chapter describes an application of telehealth using cell phones and the Internet to collect, transmit, and monitor data in real-time from female sex workers (FSW) who are part of a 20-city randomized trial in Peru to reduce sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Early detection and treatment of STDs represents one major strategy for preventing transmission of STDs, including infection with HIV. New technologies and information systems can help public health in terms of prevention, surveillance, and management of public health data. The chapter discusses some barriers, factors, and limitations in collecting data electronically in a developing country. Despite some limitations, cell phones have a valuable role in bridging the digital divide and providing solutions in public health. The chapter also addresses the importance of developing an appropriate technology and collaborating with information technology partners, and provides some lessons learned that can be generalized to other developing and developed countries.

abstract = {The BT-Nurse system uses data-to-text technology to automatically generate a natural language nursing shift summary in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The summary is solely based on data held in an electronic patient record system, no additional data-entry is required. BT-Nurse was tested for two months in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NICU. Nurses were asked to rate the understandability, accuracy, and helpfulness of the computer-generated summaries; they were also asked for free-text comments about the summaries. The nurses found the majority of the summaries to be understandable, accurate, and helpful (p{\textless}0.001 for all measures). However, nurses also pointed out many deficiencies, especially with regard to extra content they wanted to see in the computer-generated summaries. In conclusion, natural language NICU shift summaries can be automatically generated from an electronic patient record, but our proof-of-concept software needs considerable additional development work before it can be deployed.},

abstract = {The Health {\&} Quality Safety Commission New Zealand commissioned Ko Awatea, an innovation and improvement centre, to deliver a co-design programme to nine teams of healthcare providers. The co-design programme was part of Partners in Care, a broader programme developed in 2012 to support and enable patient engagement and participation across the health and disability sector. In the current programme teams received training, guidance and mentorship in Experience Based Design (EBD) methodology through a one day masterclass, seven WebEx sessions, coaching calls, email and through the completion of workbooks. We evaluated the co-design programme to explore the experiences, challenges and solutions that participating teams encountered while engaging with patients in their projects. The evaluation involved seventeen semi-structured interviews with programme participants, including seven team members, five sponsors, four patients and the programme facilitator. A further two team members provided feedback in written form and eight of nine teams provided completed workbooks. Data from the interviews and workbooks was thematically analysed. Health professionals identified key challenges to patient engagement as capturing diverse experiences, clear communication of project details and the availability and health of the patient. Patients advised the importance of improved communication, planning in advance and providing feedback and assurance about the value of their contribution. There are several important considerations to secure and maintain patient engagement in co-design. These include tailored strategies for approaching patients and capturing their experiences, pre-existing relationships and continued rapport building between patients and health professionals, good communication throughout the project, planning, and visibility of outcomes.},

But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe. The evolution in design research from a user-centered approach to co-designing is changing the roles of the designer, the researcher and the person formerly known as the "user". The implications of this shift for the education of designers and researchers are enormous. The evolution in design research from a user-centered approach to co-designing is changing the landscape of design practice as well, creating new domains of collective creativity. It is hoped that this evolution will support a transformation toward more sustainable ways of living in the future.},

First, we theoretically examine Foucault's thinking by dividing his works into archaeological, genealogical and aesthetic/ethical phases. We then conduct a review of 113 inter- national journal articles from between the years 2000 and 2009. We do this in order to obtain an overview of the phases of Foucault's thinking that are prevalent in recent organization studies. We find that recent academic studies drawing on Foucault are increasingly leaning towards Foucault's writings on governmentality, as well as on his genealogical works, which have sustained their popu- larity. Reflecting the growing interest in governmentality and genealogy, we end by pointing out some avenues for future research.},

In this work, we study how worker deliberation affects resolvability and accuracy using case studies with both an objective and a subjective task. Results show that case resolvability depends on various factors, including the level and reasons for the initial disagreement, as well as the amount and quality of deliberation activities. Our work reinforces the finding that deliberation can increase answer accuracy and the importance of verbal discussion in this process. We contribute a new public data set on worker deliberation for text classification tasks, and discuss considerations for the design of deliberation workflows for classification.},

In this important and essential new textbook, she introduces the reader to the craft of using grounded theory in social research, and provides a clear, step-by-step guide for those new to the field.Using worked examples throughout, this book also maps out an alternative vision of grounded theory put forward by its founding thinkers, Glaser and Strauss. To Charmaz, grounded theory must move on from its positivist origins and must incorporate many of the methods and questions posed by constructivists over the past twenty years to become a more nuanced and reflexive practice.Essential reading for students, new researchers and seasoned social scientists alike, this book is one of those rare things, a textbook that is both accessible to those new to the field but also one that has important things to say about the nature of social enquiry itself.},

In five workshops we facilitated, we asked members to design a new item from two existing items in need of repair and studied their acts of appropriation and reuse. Although we hoped to explore possibilities for collaborative practice, we more clearly saw what happens when garments with rich histories meet the blunt instrument of workshop interventions. Members aligned anticipated outcomes in opposition to our guidelines and abandoned projects due to personal obligations. In reflecting on these encounters we further show how workshops shape what it means to study collaborative settings.

These workshops were attended by more than 30 indigenous and non-indigenous researchers, natural resource managers, policy-makers, and representatives from government and non-governmental organizations from across Asia, Oceania, and Scandinavia. This paper builds on workshop participants' insights and illuminates key components of the process of co-creation of knowledges for and with indigenous communities, and describes some of the main challenges to, and opportunities for, transdisciplinary and cross-cultural knowledge production. We argue that indigenous methodologies offer important lessons for current efforts within global sustainability research to integrate different knowledges and design and conduct research in culturally and ethical respectful manner.},

abstract = {AIMS: We sought to test the utility of weight gain algorithms to predict episodes of worsening heart failure (WHF) using home-telemonitoring data collected as part of the TEN-HMS study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Simple rule-of-thumb (RoT) algorithms (i.e. 3 lbs in 1 day and 5 lbs in 3 days) and a moving average convergence divergence (MACD) algorithm were compared. WHF was defined as hospitalization for WHF or worsening of breathlessness or leg oedema. Of 168 patients, 45 were hospitalized with WHF and 76 were hospitalized for other reasons. On average, weight gain occurred in the 14 days prior to WHF hospitalizations but not in the 14 days prior to non-WHF hospitalizations [1.9 +/- 4.7 lbs (0.9 +/- 2.1 kg) vs. -0.4 +/- 2.5 lbs (-0.2 +/- 1.1 kg), P {\textless} 0.0001]. The true alerts rate was higher for the RoT algorithms compared with the MACD (58 and 65{\%} vs. 20{\%}). However, the RoT algorithms had much higher false alert rates (54 and 58{\%} vs. 9{\%}) rendering them of little practical use for predicting WHF events. CONCLUSION: A MACD algorithm is more specific but less sensitive than RoT when trying to predict episodes of WHF based on daily weight measurements.

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether parents of Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) transitioning home with the NICU-2-Home smartphone application have greater parenting self-efficacy, are better prepared for discharge and have shorter length of stay (LOS) than control parents. Methods: A four-week pilot randomized controlled trial during the transition home with 90 VLBW parents randomized to usual care (n = 44) or usual care plus NICU-2-Home (n = 46), a smartphone application designed for VLBW parents. Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) was assessed at baseline, day after discharge, and two weeks post-discharge. Preparedness for discharge and length of stay (LOS) were secondary outcomes. Analyses by usage were also included. Results: While parents of VLBW infants in the intervention group did not show an improvement in PSOC during the transition when compared directly to controls, after accounting for actual mean app usage, PSOC improved 7{\%} (2.71 points/time greater; 95{\%} CI = 1.45, 6.27) for intervention versus controls. Compared to controls, above-average users increased their PSOC score by 14{\%} (6.84 points/time; 95{\%} CL = 5.02, 8.67), average users by 11{\%} (4.58 points/time; 95{\%} CL = 2.89, 6.27) and below-average users by 6{\%} (2.41 points/time; 95{\%} CL = 0.04, 4.79). Moderate evidence showed LOS was shorter for above-average users compared to the control group (?? = 12.2. SE = 6.9, p = 0.085). Conclusion: A smartphone application used by parents of VLBW infants during the transition home from the NICU can improve parenting self-efficacy, discharge preparedness, and LOS with improved benefits based on usage.},

Yet it is still unclear what methods provide effective insight into the nature of embodiment in HCI in relation to both design and use. This paper presents work in progress on MIDAS, a cross-disciplinary methodological research project on embodiment and technology exploring synergies across the fields of Digital Arts and Social Sciences. We argue that exploiting these synergies can contribute towards an integrated, innovative and progressive framework for understanding digital body interactions. We introduce the 5 ongoing case studies that inform MIDAS, outline the project's use of multimodal ethnography, and discuss two emerging themes: "conceptualising the body" and "the sensory", which will contribute to a methodological framework for informing future design, analysis and evaluation of HCI systems.},

Culturally relevant information and support should be created to enable the communities to reclaim this traditionally revered infant feeding method. The objective of this participatory design study was to work in partnership with Indigenous communities to create an eHealth breastfeeding resource for Indigenous families. METHODOLOGY In partnership with Indigenous mothers and care providers in Ontario, Canada, an eHealth breastfeeding resource was designed based on their recommendations. Once the new resource was created, it was evaluated by additional Indigenous mothers. RESULTS The participants indicated the resource was culturally relevant and that they liked the content and design. DISCUSSION Using a participatory design when creating services and programs in partnership with Indigenous communities ensures the creation of resources that meet their needs, are culturally relevant, and align with cultural beliefs.},

@techreport{Somerville2007,
abstract = {The first years of the new millennium have seen dramatic changes in how information is produced, as well as how it is organized and accessed. Within the increasingly digital environment, technology continues to transform how we encounter and experience information. For example, individuals can now produce and share their own information, rather than waiting for book or journal publishers to create and deliver the material-a concept known as peer production. Internet-based social networking sites offer yet another popular way to create and exchange unmediated information. Because these new technology tools enable easy information production and consumption, individuals increasingly circumvent what has traditionally been the role of libraries-organizing, managing, and enabling access. These circumstances challenge libraries' traditional role as repositories of human culture, forcing libraries to evolve. The dynamically changing information landscape prompted faculty researchers from four institutions on three continents to develop a collaborative approach for co-designing libraries of the future. The methodology evolved out of projects involving students in working alongside academic librarians and other campus stakeholders to co-create digital learning objects and digital learning environments. Highly participatory in nature, the design processes benefited from the knowledge of students raised in the United States, Sweden, and Australia, who have grown up with the digital technologies developed in the last decades of the 20 th century and now widely available in the new millennium. These students have spent their entire lives using computers, video games, digital music players, video cameras, mobile phones, email, instant messaging, and other technology tools and toys. As a result, these 'digital natives' think and act differently than the people for whom today's libraries were designed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of family- centered care in neonatal intensive care unit has changed drastically in protracted years and has been used in various contexts differently. Since we require clarity in our understanding, we aimed to analyze this concept.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This study was done on the basis of developmental approach of Rodgers's concept analysis. We reviewed the existing literature in Science direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Iran Medex databases from 1980 to 2012. The keywords were family-centered care, family-oriented care, and neonatal intensive care unit. After all, 59 out of 244 English and Persian articles and books (more than 20{\%}) were selected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The attributes of family-centered care in neonatal intensive care unit were recognized as care taking of family (assessment of family and its needs, providing family needs), equal family participation (participation in care planning, decision making, and providing care from routine to special ones), collaboration (inter-professional collaboration with family, family involvement in regulating and implementing care plans), regarding family's respect and dignity (importance of families' differences, recognizing families' tendencies), and knowledge transformation (information sharing between healthcare workers and family, complete information sharing according to family learning style). Besides, the recognized antecedents were professional and management-organizational factors. Finally, the consequences included benefits related to neonate, family, and organization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The findings revealed that family centered-care was a comprehensive and holistic caring approach in neonatal intensive care. Therefore, it is highly recommended to change the current care approach and philosophy and provide facilities for conducting family-centered care in neonatal intensive care unit.},

The design process is about finding solutions to address problems, practical innovations that open up possibilities and improvements that enhance peopleʼs lives. In recent years the design process has been applied to improving services rather than only focussing on material goods and products -this is often referred to as ʻservice designʼ. Service design is also increasingly applied to social services, in an attempt to improve the ways in which these services generate social impact. Social services can indeed be ʻdesignedʼ. In fact most social services are subject to some very intentional and deliberate thought processes and design adds another framework around which such processes can be structured. What is co-design? Co-design is about engaging consumers and users of products and services in the design process, with the idea that this will ultimately lead to improvements and innovation. In this blog Iʼm going to reflect a little on what co-design of social services means and whether it can lead to greater social impact. In my next blog Iʼll explore some key principles of co-designing social services and highlight a few methods and tools.},

Based on our study data, we present a series of considerations unique to the nine-month period of pregnancy that need to be accounted for in mobile health design. Specifically, we: (1) identify challenges in the use of diet, weight, and activity tracking application design paradigms that are specific to the pregnancy experience; (2) introduce a structuring concept we call the pregnancy ecology, which accounts for the information, physical and emotional self-care, and social support needs of pregnant women. This concept allows for a paradigm shift away from activity, diet, and weight tracking applications; and finally, we (3) provide design considerations for mobile health applications geared toward the needs of pregnant women},

Aims: To examine the effectiveness of a method called 'facilitated tucking by parents' (a parent holds the infant in a flexed position) in pain management during endotracheal/pharyngeal suctioning of preterm infants. In addition, the parental perception of the method was studied. Study design: A randomized crossover trial. Subjects: Twenty preterm infants with one of their parents participated in the study. Infants' gestational age ranged from 24 to 33 (median 28) weeks and postnatal age from 6 to 37 days (median 15 days). Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) score. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were recorded. Parents completed a questionnaire about their perception of the procedure. Results: The highest NIPS score was median 3 (range from 2 to 6) using 'facilitated tucking by parents' and median 5 (range from 2 to 7) without tucking during suctioning (p {\textless} 0.001). The infants calmed down more quickly after 'facilitated tucking by parents' (5 s vs. 17 s, p = 0.024). Nineteen out of twenty parents preferred facilitated tucking during suctioning compared to control care. Conclusions: Facilitated tucking by parents is an effective and safe pain management method during suctioning of preterm infants. This study shows that parents can be given an active role in the pain care of their preterm infants. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This expert consensus statement reviews evidence on the effectiveness of drug and alcohol self-help groups and presents potential implications for clinicians, treatment program managers and policymakers. Because longitudinal studies associate self-help group involvement with reduced substance use, improved psychosocial functioning, and lessened health care costs, there are humane and practical reasons to develop self-help group supportive policies. Policies described here that could be implemented by clinicians and program managers include making greater use of empirically-validated self-help group referral methods in both specialty and non-specialty treatment settings and developing a menu of locally available self-help group options that are responsive to client's needs, preferences, and cultural background. The workgroup also offered possible self-help supportive policy options (e.g., supporting self-help clearinghouses) for state and federal decision makers. Implementing such policies could strengthen alcohol and drug self-help organizations, and thereby enhance the national response to the serious public health problem of substance abuse. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Within our research project Shaping Future, we applied this key feature and developed a methodology for the purpose of setting need-oriented research agendas in the field of human-machine interaction. Our current results suggest that methods of participatory design can be invaluable for co-determining research trajectories and co-setting research agendas. By promoting interaction on equal terms and transcending terminology barriers, these methods can help re-orient science and technology development toward public preference. In view of the dynamic evolution of participatory design, our project can help uncover new research fields and develop new approaches to technology development. This paper presents our theoretical framework, the process design and the developed methodology, giving insights in the interdisciplinary evaluation of generated data.},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.},

abstract = {Parenting the infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) comes with a multitude of unique challenges, and NICU parents are often unprepared and ill equipped for the challenges. Moreover, a gap in the literature still exists concerning a full understanding of the breadth of the process parents of NICU infants undergo from the time of admission to discharge. This study utilized Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnography synthesis method for literature extraction and data analysis to illuminate the NICU parenting process by metaphorically comparing the process to Patricia Benner's novice to expert theory. Fourteen studies including 12 published qualitative research articles and 2 dissertations from the nursing discipline were included in the analysis. Findings illuminated the process of becoming a NICU parent more fully and revealed the most salient and effective facilitators of the process from being a novice and advanced beginner to becoming a competent, proficient, even expert NICU parent. In addition, this paper discusses four influencing factors in a NICU parent's progression: contact with and proximity to their infant, relationship with the nurse, having information, and social support. Nurses must engage with NICU parents in such a way as to maximize the likelihood that these parents will reach at minimum the proficient and at maximum the expert parenting stage by discharge.},

years and is broadly defined as promoting a partnership between the
parents and health care professionals in the care of the child. Although
recognized by many as the ideal way to care for children and families,
previous reviews showed a lack of evidence for its efficacy. A recent
Cochrane review recommended further rigorous research to assess the
model's effect. Other reports emerged to ascertain FCC poor
implementation. There is also a paucity of studies investigating the
model outside the Western context. This article dissects the literature
and provides a comprehensive summary on FCC in the context of limited
resources versus best practice. Lessons learned from the literature for
the reproducibility of the model in the developing world are provided.
Considered a luxury, the autocratic health systems in most of these
countries will not easily accept such a model of care except with a
greater understanding and support for the model and high-quality
research that can guide hospitals, health systems, and policy makers.},

In these environments, ICT interventions often fail because political, social and cultural forces work against the changes ICTs entail. We argue that familiar uses of ICTs for information services in these contexts are less potent than their use for persuasion and motivation in order to facilitate change. We focus on India's rural maternal health system where health workers are employed in villages to persuade pregnant women to utilize health services. Health workers face challenges due to resistance to change in the village, and because of their limited education, training and status. These factors appear to reduce the motivation of health workers and impair their performance. For two months, we deployed short videos on mobile phones designed to persuade village women and motivate health workers. We also asked health workers to record their own videos. While our results are preliminary, they show evidence that the creation and use of videos did help (1) engage village women in dialogue, (2) show positive effects toward health worker motivation and learning, and (3) motivate key community influencers to participate in promoting the health workers.},

Background: nursing supports for parents in the NNU is known to facilitate their coping in a stressful environment. Fathers are increasingly becoming more involved in their children's care and yet the majority of studies on support in the NNU tend to focus on mothers. There is paucity of research investigating fathers support needs and those published are mainly qualitative. Method: A quantitative descriptive design with fathers (n=58) using an instrument underpinned by social support theory. Findings: Overall fathers (n=50) indicated receiving a high level of neonatal nursing support and eight fathers (n=8) received a moderate amount. Overall, fathers indicated receiving a moderate to high level in information, emotional, appraisal and care-giving functional nursing supports. Of the four functional nursing supports, emotional support was deemed the lowest. Conclusion: on admission to NNU, all fathers should be assessed to determine their functional social support needs within the unit. Neonatal nurses need to reflect on their relationship with fathers. Following individual assessment, care plans should address the unique nursing support needs of fathers and the most appropriate person to provide each functional social support within the NNU, including emotional support.},

We define the term creative in such a way that includes terminology common in both design and research practice. This protocol outlines the steps taken to systematically investigate what is known from existing literature about CRM exploring user experience in research and architectural design processes in healthcare generally or in cancer care in particular. It relays the search strategy for a database search and an additional search of grey literature. The protocol is expected to be helpful in carrying out reviews in related fields contributing to knowledge synthesis techniques for qualitative research. We furthermore anticipate that the dissemination of design-related research outside of peer-reviewed journals will continue and will require further work to ensure inclusion in processes of knowledge synthesis. The final review will give insight into why, where and how CRM are currently employed and applied to gauge the user experience of healthcare environments.},

This study aimed to establish the determinants of survival in this weight category of neonates, who, owing to limited intensive care facilities, were not mechanically ventilated. Design. A retrospective study in which patient data were retrieved from the departmental computer database. Setting. The neonatal unit at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. Subjects. Neonates admitted at birth between January 2006 and December 2010 with birth weights of .900 g. Outcome measures. Survival at discharge was the major outcome. Maternal variables were age, parity, gravidity, antenatal care, antenatal steroids, place and mode of delivery and HIV status. Neonatal variables were gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), gender, place of birth, hypothermia, resuscitation at birth, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, jaundice, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) with or without surfactant, and Apgar scores. Results. A total of 382 neonates were included in the study. Overall survival was 26.5{\%}. The main causes of death, as per the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP) classification, were extreme multi-organ immaturity and respiratory distress syndrome. The main determinants of survival were BW (odds ratio (OR) 0.994; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.991 - 0.997) and GA (OR 0.827; 95{\%} CI 0.743 - 0.919). Overall the rate of NCPAP use was 15.5{\%}, and NCPAP was not associated with improved survival. Conclusion. Survival of ELBW infants is low. BW and GA were the strongest predictors of survival. Effective steps are required to avoid extreme prematurity, encourage antenatal care, and provide antenatal steroids when preterm birth is anticipated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

For more than a decade, infant mortality rates have been 2 to 3 times higher among African American populations, rates of potentially preventable hospitalization have been substantially higher among African American and Latino populations, and the complications of diabetes have disproportionately afflicted African American and Latino populations.1 These and other disparities have persisted despite recognition that inequity costs the economy an estimated {\$}300 billion per year.2 In addition, health disparities threaten the ability of health care organizations to compete fiscally as insurers increasingly base payments on quality and outcomes, such as reducing preventable admissions and readmissions.},

We present a case study of the existence and quality of support networks available to people with AIDS and their carers in a South African rural area. Drawing on 45 interviews and 13 focus groups, we identify key local HIV/AIDS-relevant actors and agencies in civil society, the public and the private sectors. The most effective support comes from families and neighbours, volunteer health workers and two lone missionaries. This support is undermined by counter-productive responses by faith-based organisations, traditional healers and local leaders, and by poor levels of support from public and private sector agencies. We discuss ways in which existing and latent networks might best be strengthened and supported.},

Research on these relationships typically focuses on only two of the groups. This study examines the relationships between all three groups simultaneously and asks how each participant in the interaction perceives their own and others' roles. I studied the case of how C-section decisions are made through in-depth qualitative interviews with six obstetricians, five nurses in the OBGYN, and six women who had C-sections. I asked about their roles and interactions, and how they were perceived by others. In cases of disagreement about having a C-section, there tended to be some miscommunication or power struggle making mutual agreement among the participants difficult to achieve. Sometimes, disagreements were not only the result of differing individual opinions, but were influenced by broader, often covert, institutional constraints that shaped the participants' roles and the decisions made. While adding a multi-perspective analysis, I also suggest ways doctors, nurses and patients can interact to make decisions more equally to improve the experience of all persons involved. These results may provide guiding principles for doctors, nurses and patients outside the context of C-sections as well.},

abstract = {Background. Little is known about parental experience and decision making with regard to premature infants requiring intensive care in developing countries. We undertook this study to characterise parents' experience of physician counselling and their role in making life-support decisions for very low-birth-weight (VLBW) (birth weight {\textless} 1501 g) infants born in South Africa's public-sector neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Methods. Parents of surviving VLBW infants treated in three Johannesburg-area public hospitals and attending follow-up clinics in August 2001 were interviewed regarding their experience of perinatal counselling on outcomes (pain, survival, disability), perception of actual and optimal decision making, and satisfaction with NICU communication. Results. Parents of 51 infants were interviewed. Seventy-five per cent of parents reported antenatal counselling by physicians on at least one perinatal topic (severe disability, pain, death, finances or religious/moral considerations). The majority of parents ( {\textgreater} 60{\%}) who received counselling thought that these topics had been discussed adequately. Most parents reported that doctors had the primary decision-making role, either without consulting them (41{\%}) or after consulting them (37{\%}). joint decision making was rare (14{\%}). Parents wanted more input in life-support decisions than they reported being given. Conclusion. Counselling is not consistently provided in public-sector hospitals in Johannesburg. Parents of premature infants want a larger share in NICU decision making than they currently experience. Most parents were satisfied with communication later during their infant's hospitalisation. South Africa presents a unique opportunity to study the use of advanced medical technologies in a nation with marked disparities in access to care.},

All topical sessions contain specific aims and objectives, clearly outlining the skills that will be developed and corresponding learning outcomes. Practical activities have been designed to encourage reflection, provoke discussions, build skills and ensure the local relevance of information.

The creative application of participatory design methods facilitates a design process in which values emerge and become inscribed in a prototype. We present PD's guiding principles: equalising power relations, democratic practices, situation-based action, mutual learning, tools and techniques, and alternative visions about technology. In addition we discuss some value practices and design methods informed by our PD projects in healthcare and the public sector.

Parents' need for communication may not always be met by the NICU staff. This study aimed to describe strengths and weaknesses of parent–nurse and parent–doctor communication in a large level III NICU in Sweden in order to improve our understanding of parents' communication needs. Parents were asked to complete a survey consisting of sixteen questions about their experiences of communication with nurses and doctors in the NICU. In each question the parents evaluated some aspect of communication on a five- or six-point Likert scale. They also had the opportunity on each question to comment on their experiences in their own words. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and qualitative manifest content analysis. 270 parents (71.4{\%}) completed the survey. Parents generally rated communication with the staff in the NICU positively and appreciated having received emotional support and regular information about their child´s care. Although a large majority of the parents were satisfied with their communication with doctors and nurses, only about half of the parents felt the nurses and doctors understood their emotional situation very well. Some parents would have desired easier access to conversations with doctors and wanted medical information to be given directly by doctors rather than by nurses. Parents' communication with the staff was hampered when many different nurses were involved in caring for the infant or when the transfer of information in connection with shift changes or between the maternity ward and NICU was poor. Parents also desired to be present during doctors' rounds on their infant. Training both doctors and nurses in communication skills, especially in how to meet parents' emotional needs better, could make communication at the NICU more effective and improve parental well-being. Creating a framework for the parents of what to expect from NICU communication might also be helpful. In addition, our results support the use of primary nurse teams to improve continuity of care and thereby promote successful communication.},

Moreover, there is a substantial association between effective parenting of infants and sustaining a mutually satisfying couple relationship. This paper reviews randomized controlled trials of psycho-education to assist new parent couples with parenting and their couple relationship. The majority of programs target either the couple relationship or parenting, with few programs addressing both areas. The best outcomes seem to be achieved when programs are accessible by couples at home, when skill-training is provided, and possibly when programs target couples at high-risk of maladjustment to parenthood. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

This program successfully ended, and video-conferencing is incorporated as a tool to support families after coming home. Probably, a variety of factors has contributed to make this program suc-cessful, as for example user friendliness and the close collaboration between researchers and staff at the neonatal unit.

abstract = {Many different health service models for providing neonatal intensive care have been established over the past 30 years, and much of the developed world is moving towards a centralised model of care. At least initially, preterm infants often require specialised care in an intensive care setting. As a result, newborn infants and pregnant mothers may have to move between hospitals for appropriate care because of prematurity or the threat of preterm delivery. Sometimes this move means that the infant and family have to travel hundreds of miles. This article focuses on the postnatal transfer of preterm infants between hospitals. Antenatal transfer of pregnant women is not considered here, although in utero transfer has better clinical outcomes for mother and infant than transfer after birth. Many of the issues discussed are applicable to transfers within hospitals},

Closed-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and conventional qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended responses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Participants were recruited via the Facebook sites of two online milk-sharing networks (Human Milk 4 Human Babies and Eats on Feet).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight milk donors and 41 milk recipients who had donated or received breast milk in an arrangement that was facilitated via the Internet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: One half of donor recipients could not donate to a milk bank because there were no banks local to them or they did not qualify as donors. Other respondents did not donate to a milk bank because they viewed the process as difficult, had philosophical objections to milk banking, or had a philosophical attraction to peer sharing. Most donor respondents felt it was important to know the circumstances of their milk recipients. No recipient respondents had obtained milk from a milk bank; it was recognized that they would not qualify for banked milk or that banked milk was cost prohibitive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Peer-to-peer milk donors and recipients may differ from milk bank donors and recipients in significant ways.

abstract = {Neonatal-perinatal ill health and mortality are overwhelmingly a burden of the developing world. As many as 90{\%} of births, 98{\%} of fetal deaths and 98{\%} of neonatal deaths occur in less developed countries. Regionalized perinatal services were introduced in developed countries when most neonatal mortality was confined to very-low-birthweight babies who required intensive perinatal care to survive. A large proportion of newborn morbidity and mortality in developing countries, however, continues to occur among full-term and moderate-sized low-birthweight neonates who can be managed well in the community and at small hospitals. The model of regionalized perinatal care as practiced in developed countries is, at present, neither affordable nor relevant to the needs of many developing countries. It is possible to achieve considerably lower neonatal mortality rates in resource-poor settings by implementing home-based newborn care delivered by community health workers, and by promoting institutional perinatal care at simple facilities provided by trained midwives. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN: Costs applied to the hospital service utilization profile of each infant born in 2 areas covered by the Oxford Record Linkage Study during 1970-1993. SETTING: Oxfordshire and West Berkshire, southern United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: 239 694 individuals divided into 4 subgroups by gestational age at birth: {\textless}28 weeks, 28 to 31 weeks, 32 to 36 weeks, {\textgreater}or=37 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and duration of hospital admissions during the first 5 years of life and costs, expressed in pound sterling and valued at 1998-1999 prices, of hospital inpatient services. RESULTS: The total duration of hospital admissions for infants born at {\textless}28 and at 28 to 31 gestational weeks was 85 and 16 times that for term infants, respectively, once duration of life had been taken into account. Hospital inpatient service costs were significantly higher for preterm infants than for term infants, with the cost differences persisting throughout infancy and early and mid-childhood. Over the first 5 years of life, the adjusted mean cost difference was estimated at pound 14,614 ( 22,798 US dollars) when infants born at {\textless}28 weeks gestational age were compared with term infants and pound 11,958 ( 18,654 US dollars) when infants born at 28 to 31 weeks gestational age were compared with term infants. Independent contributions to total cost came from being born: small for gestational age, a multiple, during the 1970s and early 1980s, to a woman of extreme maternal age or who was hospitalized antenatally, and from experiencing extended survival or childhood disease. However, preterm birth remained the strongest predictor of high cost. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth is a major predictor of how much an individual will cost hospital service providers during the first 5 years of life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can cause blindness. Before 2016, resource limitations precluded routine screening for ROP at Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH), Cape Town, South Africa. Previous pilot studies at GSH found no patients with ROP requiring treatment; however, improved preterm infant survival may affect the prevalence. OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence and severity of ROP, describe potential risk factors, and assess the feasibility of ROP screening. METHODS Infants with a birth weight (BW) of {\textless}1 251 g or a gestational age (GA) of ≤31 weeks were screened from November 2012 to May 2013. RESULTS Three hundred and thirteen ROP examinations were performed in 135 of 191 eligible infants. The mean GA and BW were 30.1 weeks (standard deviation (SD) 1.9) and 1 056 g (SD 172), respectively. ROP was diagnosed in 40 infants (29.6{\%}); 8 (5.9{\%}) had severe ROP and 2 (1.5{\%}) received laser treatment. Infants with ROP had a lower mean GA (29.2 weeks (SD 1.6) v. 30.5 weeks (SD 1.9)) (p{\textless}0.002) and a lower mean BW (988 g (SD 181) v. 1 085 g (SD 160)) (p=0.001) than those without ROP. Infants weighing {\textless}1 000 g had a 2.5 times higher risk than those with a BW of ≥1 000 g of having ROP (95{\%} confidence interval 1.05 - 5.90; p=0.03). Blood transfusions (p{\textless}0.002) and late-onset sepsis (p=0.024) were strongly associated with ROP. Screening was completed in 91.1{\%} (123/135) of the infants. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence and severity of ROP have increased at GSH. The strong association between ROP, BW and GA suggests that infants with lower BWs and GAs should be prioritised for screening in our resource-limited setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-income Caribbean transmigrant women face unique health challenges during pregnancy that set forth multidimensional implications for the design of mobile health (mHealth). Acknowledgment of the unique health needs of low-income Caribbean immigrant women in the United States and what that entails regarding technology design remains rarely examined in the literature of mHealth technologies. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to reveal the needs and gaps in mHealth interventions for pregnant immigrant women not yet realized in this field. These understandings reveal design opportunities for mHealth. METHODS: The use of the qualitative participatory action research approach of codesign workshops in this study resulted in design solutions by the participants after reflecting on their earlier focus group discussions. The highlights are not the resulting designs per se but rather the inferences derived from the researcher reflecting on these designs. RESULTS: The designs exposed two themes relevant to this paper. First, the participants desired the inclusion and rebuilding of social and organizational relationships in mHealth. The resulting designs formulate an understanding of the women's health-related social support needs and how technology can facilitate them. Second, the participants wanted entertainment with an element of social participation incorporated in mHealth pregnancy management interventions. This brings attention to the role entertainment can add to the impact mHealth can deliver for pregnancy well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded with an examination of social and entertainment design implications that reveal pregnant immigrant women's virtual health-related sharing habits, choice of sharing interaction scenarios during pregnancy (eg, local, long distance, one-way, two-way, and many-many), and choice of sharing media (eg, text, voice, and video). Additionally, the study revealed exclusions to social sharing capabilities in health technologies for these women.},

@article{Fowlie2007,
abstract = {Background: Currently, there is a diagnostic dilemma in terms of discriminating the reversible cognitive problems associated with depression from the irreversible dementia associated with early or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the elderly. Previous research has focused on contrasting memory functions in depression versus AD, and methodological limitations undermine the results of the few empirical studies that have compared the linguistic and attentional abilities of these two patient populations. Aims: The objective of the current study was to determine whether depression is associated with any unique form of deficit in language or attention, and consequently whether more comprehensive assessment of these cognitive abilities may help to distinguish depression from early AD in elderly populations. Methods {\&} Procedures: Age-matched groups of elderly adults with depression, early AD, or no psychiatric or neurological problems completed a comprehensive battery of basic and complex attention, language, and memory tests. Outcomes {\&} Results: Results indicated that of the various cognitive abilities examined, the attention abilities of the depressed group, in particular their attention performance latencies, were most compromised compared to the control group. Tests of complex attention functions, working and episodic memory, and high-level language comprehension and production were most useful at distinguishing the depressed and early AD groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that use of a small subset of high-level cognitive tests may allow accurate discrimination of elderly patients with depression from those in the early stages of AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an Internet-based telemedicine program designed to reduce the costs of care, to provide enhanced medical, informational, and emotional support to families of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during and after their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. BACKGROUND: Baby CareLink is a multifaceted telemedicine program that incorporates videoconferencing and World Wide Web (WWW) technologies to enhance interactions between families, staff, and community providers. The videoconferencing module allows virtual visits and distance learning from a family's home during an infant's hospitalization as well as virtual house calls and remote monitoring after discharge. Baby CareLink's WWW site contains information on issues that confront these families. In addition, its security architecture allows efficient and confidential sharing of patient-based data and communications among authorized hospital and community users. DESIGN/METHODS: A randomized trial of Baby CareLink was conducted in a cohort of VLBW infants born between November 1997 and April 1999. Eligible infants were randomized within 10 days of birth. Families of intervention group infants were given access to the Baby CareLink telemedicine application. A multimedia computer with WWW browser and videoconferencing equipment was installed in their home within 3 weeks of birth. The control group received care as usually practiced in this NICU. Quality of care was assessed using a standardized family satisfaction survey administered after discharge. In addition, the effect of Baby CareLink on hospital length of stay as well as family visitation and interactions with infant and staff were measured. RESULTS: Of the 176 VLBW infants admitted during the study period, 30 control and 26 study patients were enrolled. The groups were similar in patient and family characteristics as well as rates of inpatient morbidity. The CareLink group reported higher overall quality of care. Families in the CareLink group reported significantly fewer problems with the overall quality of care received by their family (mean problem score: 3{\%} vs 13{\%}). In addition, CareLink families also reported greater satisfaction with the unit's physical environment and visitation policies (mean problem score: 13{\%} vs 50{\%}). The frequency of family visits, telephone calls to the NICU, and holding of the infant did not differ between groups. The duration of hospitalization until ultimate discharge home was similar in the 2 groups (68.5 +/- 28.3 vs 70.6 +/- 35.6 days). Among infants born weighing {\textless}1000 g (n = 31) there was a tendency toward shorter lengths of stay (77.4 +/- 26.2 vs 93.1 +/- 35.6 days). All infants in the CareLink group were discharged directly to home whereas 6/30 (20{\%}) of control infants were transferred to community hospitals before ultimate discharge home. CONCLUSIONS: CareLink significantly improves family satisfaction with inpatient VLBW care and definitively lowers costs associated with hospital to hospital transfer. Our data suggest the use of telemedicine and the Internet support the educational and emotional needs of families facilitating earlier discharge to home of VLBW infants. We believe that further extension of the Baby CareLink model to the postdischarge period will significantly improve the coordination and efficiency of care.},

abstract = {Background: Parents of infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) find themselves in a situation of emotional strain. Communication in the NICU presents special challenges due to parental stress and the complexity of the highly technologized environment. Parents' need for communication may not always be met by the NICU staff. This study aimed to describe strengths and weaknesses of parent–nurse and parent–doctor communication in a large level III NICU in Sweden in order to improve our understanding of parents' communication needs. Methods: Parents were asked to complete a survey consisting of sixteen questions about their experiences of communication with nurses and doctors in the NICU. In each question the parents evaluated some aspect of communication on a five-or six-point Likert scale. They also had the opportunity on each question to comment on their experiences in their own words. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and qualitative manifest content analysis. Results: 270 parents (71.4{\%}) completed the survey. Parents generally rated communication with the staff in the NICU positively and appreciated having received emotional support and regular information about their child´s care. Although a large majority of the parents were satisfied with their communication with doctors and nurses, only about half of the parents felt the nurses and doctors understood their emotional situation very well. Some parents would have desired easier access to conversations with doctors and wanted medical information to be given directly by doctors rather than by nurses. Parents' communication with the staff was hampered when many different nurses were involved in caring for the infant or when the transfer of information in connection with shift changes or between the maternity ward and NICU was poor. Parents also desired to be present during doctors' rounds on their infant. Conclusions: Training both doctors and nurses in communication skills, especially in how to meet parents' emotional needs better, could make communication at the NICU more effective and improve parental well-being. Creating a framework for the parents of what to expect from NICU communication might also be helpful. In addition, our results support the use of primary nurse teams to improve continuity of care and thereby promote successful communication.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to identify the effects of kangaroo care on the physiological functions of preterm infants, maternal-infant attachment, and maternal stress. Design and Methods: For this study, a quasi-experiment design was used with a nonequivalent control group, and a pre- and post-test. Data were collected from preterm infants with corrected gestational ages of ≥. 33 weeks who were hospitalized between May and October 2011. Twenty infants were assigned to the experimental group and 20 to the control group. As an intervention, kangaroo care was provided in 30-min sessions conducted thrice a week for a total of 10 times. The collected data were analyzed by using the t test, repeated-measures ANOVA, and the ANCOVA test. Results: After kangaroo care, the respiration rate significantly differed between the two groups (F = 5.701, p = .020). The experimental group had higher maternal-infant attachment scores (F = 25.881, p {\textless} .001) and lower maternal stress scores (F = 47.320, p {\textless} .001) than the control group after the test. In other words, kangaroo care showed significantly positive effects on stabilizing infant physiological functions such as respiration rate, increasing maternal-infant attachment, and reducing maternal stress. Conclusion: This study suggests that kangaroo care can be used to promote emotional bonding and support between mothers and their babies, and to stabilize the physiological functions of premature babies. Practice Implications: Kangaroo care may be one of the most effective nursing interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit for the care of preterm infants and their mothers.},

Since there was no specific solution or technology in mind from the beginning, several different methods were used in combination to investigate what had meaning to the family members. Some of the methods used are: cultural probes, interviews, observations, workshops, video brainstorming, prototyping in the homes, technology probes and individual assignments. The researchers represent different academic profes- sions, mainly ethnography, industrial design, interac- tion design, computer science. To minimize the problem of ‘handing over' information, researchers from at least two different backgrounds participate in all work done together with the families. KEYWORDS},

@article{Johnston2006,
abstract = {Background: Preterm birth and the associated hospitalisation of an infant may impact on a mother's ability to confirm "motherhood status" through breastfeeding. Many studies have examined the nutritional and immunological benefits of breastmilk and possible links to cognitive development, and further work has examined the impact of demographic factors such as socioeconomic status and level of education on initiation of breastfeeding. However, there is little research to date that explores the ways in which mothers of preterm infants emotionally experience breastfeeding and how this experience relates to the process of becoming a mother. Objective: To explore how mothers of preterm infants experience breastfeeding and how the emotions associated with that experience relate to the maternal attainment process. Study design: A qualitative study using a grounded theory approach. Participants: Swedish-speaking mothers of infants born preterm ({\textless}32 weeks gestation), in seven neonatal units geographically dispersed across Sweden were eligible to participate. An additional requirement was the mothers should have experienced breastfeeding or pumping breast milk while their baby was in the neonatal unit. Data collection: An interview guide was used to explore mothers' previous experiences of breastfeeding, their emotions whilst in the neonatal unit, barriers to breastfeeding and strategies used to overcome barriers. Interviews took place in the homes of mothers, lasted 40 min to 3.5 hours, and were audiotaped and transcribed. Results: Three themes emerged from an analysis of the data: 1) the "loss" of the infant and the emotional chaos, 2) separation-feelings of unimportance in terms of a role as a mother, and 3) critical issues faced in the journey of attaining motherhood. Mothers reported feeling like failures, with social bonds with family and friends strained. Many reported the initiation of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding as the first step towards gaining normality and feeling important as a mother. Mothers described themselves as slowly changing from "watchers" to "doers" as they took over providing care for their infant. Authors' conclusions: The quality of social bonds a mother has with their infant, the father, and staff of the unit has important implications for the successful establishment of breastfeeding. An initially "distrustful" relationship as a result of separation from the baby, and uncertainty about the baby's long term outcome impacted on a woman's capacity to feel like a mother and hence their breastfeeding success. {\textcopyright} 2006 Neonatal Nurses Association.},

abstract = {Two protocols that were developed to address risks related to emotional distress in an ongoing, qualitative, community-based study of adolescent dating violence are presented. The first protocol is for use in telephone screening to identify individuals at high risk of adverse emotional reactions. The second protocol guides interviewer's responses to emotional distress expressed by participants during in-depth research interviews. The study is briefly described, and the process used to develop the protocols is discussed. The process of developing the protocols caused the authors to reconsider some previously held assumptions about human subject protections in research on sensitive topics. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objectives: Research has shown that mobile applications provide a powerful alternative to traditional paper diaries; however, little data exists in comparing apps to the traditional mode of paper as a patient education and engagement tool in the clinical setting. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of a mobile app versus a spiral-notebook guide throughout prenatal care. Methods: This randomized (n = 173) controlled pilot was conducted at an East Coast community hospital. Chi-square and repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test intervention effects in the sample of 127 pregnant mothers who completed their prenatal care in the healthcare system. Results: Patients who were distributed the mobile application used the tool to record information about pregnancy more frequently (p =04) and developed greater patient activation (p =02) than patients who were distributed notebooks. No difference was detected on interpersonal clinical communication. Conclusion: A mobile application successfully activated a patient population in which self-management is a critical factor. Practice implications: This study shows that mobile apps can prompt greater use and result in more activated patients. Findings may be translated to other patient populations who receive recurring care for chronic disease.},

abstract = {Over several years, our team has been involved in participatory design of novel future technologies with people in resource-constrained contexts in India and Kenya. A key motivator is to include these groups, who often have lower literacy, infrequent access to data connections, low exposure to technology, and other constraints, in the process of shaping and appropriating devices and services. This is in contrast to what typically happens in such regions, where technologies from traditional markets (e.g., in USA and Europe) "trickle down" after several years. In this case study, we explore the potential and barriers of one such new platform-the Physical Web-in resource-constrained contexts in Mumbai and Nairobi. The Physical Web is an open source Bluetooth-based beacon system, which aims to provide quick and seamless interaction with physical objects over a web platform. Our goal is to understand how this emerging technology might provide local small enterprise traders in these regions with the facility to quickly and easily create and distribute a simple online presence via a local broadcasting medium. In this case study we discuss the design rationale for the approach in terms of how it might address issues around users' resource constraints, and present initial findings from deployments in the two locations.

abstract = {Digitalization is the societal change process in which new ICT-based solutions bring forward completely new ways of doing things, new businesses and new movements in the society. Digitalization also provides completely new ways of addressing issues related to global health. This paper provides an overview of the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and in what way the field has contributed to international development in different regions of the world. Additionally, it outlines the United Nations' new sustainability goals from December 2015 and what these could contribute to the development of global health and its relationship to digitalization. Finally, it argues why and how HCI could be adopted and adapted to fit the contextual needs, the need for localization and for the development of new digital innovations. The research methodology is mostly qualitative following an action research paradigm in which the actual change process that the digitalization is evoking is equally important as the scientific conclusions that can be drawn. In conclusion, the paper argues that digitalization is fundamentally changing the society through the development and use of digital technologies and may have a profound effect on the digital development of every country in the world. But it needs to be developed based on local practices, it needs international support and to not be limited by any technological constraints. Particularly digitalization to support global health requires a profound understanding of the users and their context, arguing for user-centred systems design methodologies as particularly suitable.},

Objectives: The aim of the study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of mothers regarding care of their hospitalised preterm infants in a neonatal unit in a public hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. Method: This study utilised a qualitative exploratory and descriptive phenomenological study design. Mothers of hospitalised preterm infants were purposefully selected, with whom there was extensive engagement. Two in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant (P). Results: Mothers were shocked by the sudden birth of a preterm infant and found the neonatal environment intimidating. This increased their fear and anxiety and delayed development of a relationship with their infants. Support from staff, other mothers in the neonatal unit and family members enabled the mothers to overcome their fear and to develop an emotional connection with their infants. Conclusion: On-going supportive communication with the mothers by healthcare professionals promotes their confidence and competence in caring for their preterm infants, which in turn promotes mother–infant attachment.},

This was a qualitative study using interviews to gain reflections from participants. These interview transcripts were analyzed using framework analysis. Participants were recruited from three disparate organizations, a public health team of a local authority, a mental health charity and a UK National Health Service mental health initiative. Six main themes were identified, namely; design practice, collaborative working, creating an environment for innovation, team skills and attitudes and transfer of knowledge. The findings suggest that the design approach can contribute to a range of factors that have been identified as valuable for innovative teams.

abstract = {This study sets out to establish and explain the empirical link between HIV/AIDS and poverty using data collected by the 1998 South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS). Analysis is restricted to women of reproductive age (15 - 49 years). The results indicate an increased risk of HIV infection among the poor, due to poverty-related characteristics of low education and low knowledge of the means of avoiding HIV infection, as opposed to the non-poor. Moreover, the poor and the less educated were found to be more likely not to use condoms than the non-poor. The results do not, however, provide the reasons for these relations and as such further research is required. One possible explanation was financial dependence on their partners, as it was found that women who received money from their partners, as well as those who came from households where hunger was a common phenomenon, were more likely not to use condoms because their partners disliked condoms, than those who did not receive money from their partners. The results also hinted at the intricacy of the poverty-HIV/AIDS relationship, so that it was not only low socio-economic status that increased susceptibility to HIV infection but also high socio-economic status.},

abstract = {This review explores the specific issues that cluster around the provision of 'care' in the context of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. We argue that the economic concept of the 'care economy' provides a useful lens through which to view the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as it illuminates the increased labour, time and other demands placed upon households and shows that the assumptions on which norms and expectations of care provision are based are increasingly being challenged. While some strides are being made in policy and programming around HIV and AIDS-related care, much more needs to be known and done to enable individuals, families and households to survive in a world shaken by AIDS. Care, we argue, provides fundamental public goods. A strategy of simply downloading responsibility for care onto women, families and communities can no longer be a viable, appropriate or sustainable response. And this is no less true in this current era of expanding treatment options for people living with HIV and AIDS. Our analysis suggests that there are two distinct but inter-related areas for policy intervention and development. The first concerns international health policy and we argue that the international 'care agenda' needs to incorporate an understanding of the care economy into its frameworks and strategies for action, giving particular focus to the caregiver. The second area encompasses a broad national healthcare policy agenda, where a range of public, private and non-governmental sector actors come together with common purpose to ensure that households affected by HIV and AIDS are protected and enabled to survive.},

The primary goal of this research project was to determine whether Hofstedes 1991 cultural dimensions affect the performance achieved through the use of human-computer interaction. In order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to (1) identify the characteristics of the cultural dimensions; (2) identify test subjects and test interfaces displaying appropriate cultural dimensions and (3) assess the impact of these cultural dimensions on the speed, accuracy and satisfaction levels achieved by test subjects using the test interfaces to perform data collection tasks. Test subjects and website interfaces were identified in terms of the cultural dimension characteristics. The test subjects were selected based not only on their cultural dimensions, but also by controlling for user profile variables. The data resulting from the experiment was then analyzed to establish whether these dimensions had any impact on the performance achieved when using these websites. The results of the experiment did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that any of the tested cultural dimensions affected human performance. However, the performance levels attained suggest that the usability of the interfaces was increased for all users, as a result of accommodating high uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, collectivism and high power distance characteristics into the design of the interfaces. In addition, two main categories of further research have arisen as a result of this research. The first category comprises new research questions. The second focuses on the changes that should be made to the research design used for this research effort.},

abstract = {Aims and objectives: The aim was to explore how a participatory design (PD) approach involving adult patients and parents of children with disabilities could contribute to the development of an electronic "Individual Care Plan" (e-ICP) in Norway. The system was intended to simplify multi-disciplinary cross-sector documentation and collaboration between care professionals and patients in care planning. Methods: The data in the study comprised semi-structured interviews with patients and parents, as well as field notes. Systematic text condensation (STC) in a stepwise analysis model was performed on the data. Results: Testing through three phases resulted in system improvements and additional functionality according to the participating patients' needs and requests. PD was initially applied, enabling a constructive dialogue between developers and patients. System training and collecting patient expectations was a preliminary task. Patients then brought testing experiences to the system developers, focusing first on access to information and document filing. Later, finalizing testing towards a tool for interaction with care professionals was a main concern. Conclusion: Adult patients and parents participating in the study provided various insights and expectations that informed system improvements and resulted in new functionality. System development and testing in healthcare can successfully incorporate patient involvement.},

abstract = {Purpose: In the resent years the healthcare system has moved to inter-professional, cross-disciplinary, multi-person approach where the communications are very important for ensuring patient safety. Communication in health organisations needs to be studied and analysed deeply and comprehensively because the future of an organisation often depends on good communication. The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyse the reasons for ineffective communication between medical specialists in the teams they work in. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire method is used. Through a survey over a period of 12 months (from 01. 12. 2014 to 01. 12. 2015) at the Escullap Hospital in Pazardzhik, DCC 18 - Sofia, St. Mina Hospital in Plovdiv, MHAT – Plovdiv, DCC 1 in Haskovo, UMHAT in Stara Zagora, DCC 3 in Varna and MHAT – Parvomay, was studied and analyzed the opinion of medical specialists on the effectiveness of communication within the team they work in. The survey includes 477 medical specialists. Results and conclusions: According to 41.1{\%} of the respondents, the communication in the team they work in is insufficiently effective. Most of the respondents (39.8{\%}) find their colleagues responsible for the ineffective communication, followed by those who seek the cause for poor communication in the management of the health care facility (27.6{\%}). The leading cause of poor communication in the team according to the study participants is the inequality between the characters of the colleagues (41.9{\%}). According to the majority of respondents (28.3{\%}), improvements in facilities and wage increases (27.3{\%}) would be essential to improve communication within the team they work in. Recommendations have been formulated to improve communication among medical specialists.},

The author argues that the critique is misdirected, and based on Bent Flyvbjerg's concept of a “critical case,” ways of generalizing from case studies are indicated (Iran/Iraq War of 1980). In addition, the author illustrates that the case study is idyllic for generalizing using the brand of test that Karl Popper called “fal- sification.” Conversely, the author exhibits Robert Stake's ethos that case studies need not make any claims about the generalizability of their findings but rather, what is crucial is the use others make of them—chiefly, that they feed into processes of “naturalistic generalization.”},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has affected the infant-feeding experiences of HIV-positive mothers in South Africa. METHODS: This was a qualitative interview study within a prospective cohort study. We purposively selected a subsample of 40 women from a larger cohort of 650 HIV-positive mothers for in-depth interviews. FINDINGS: The HIV epidemic has changed the context in which infant-feeding choices are made and implemented. HIV-positive mothers in this study -- who were predominantly young, single and unemployed -- were struggling to protect their decision-making autonomy. Uncertainty about the safety of breastfeeding has increased the power and influence of health workers, who now act as gatekeepers to not only this new knowledge but also to essential resources such as formula milk. Fear of disclosure of HIV status and stigma has also weakened the ability of mothers to resist entrenched family and community norms that encourage early introduction of fluids and foods and that question non-breastfeeding. Women who chose to exclusively formula feed had difficulties accessing formula milk because of inflexible policies and a lack of supplies at clinics. Limited postpartum support led to social isolation and mothers doubting their ability to care for their children. CONCLUSION: The infant-feeding experiences of HIV-positive mothers have serious implications for the operational effectiveness of programmes that aim to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child. A better understanding of how HIV is changing infant-feeding practices can inform the development of interventions to improve infant-feeding counselling and postpartum support.},

abstract = {Abstract: In this manuscript we describe our “empowerment design” work. Instead of simply building an artifact to help an individual accomplish a particular task, the focus of empowerment design work is to develop socio-technical structures that empower individuals and societies more generally. Essentially, empowerment design is designing with heart. It is a complex work that involves bringing together multiple and even opposing agendas, acknowledging different voices, and even working through unintended consequences and confusing struggles that have no one clear answer. Here, we describe an empowerment design initiative that overtly attempts to transform a culture and empower those it serves by way of a technology-rich educational innovation called Quest Atlantis. While the project is currently situated in various informal and formal learning environments, much of the data in this account is focused on our collaboration with a local Boys and Girls Club that serves disadvantaged children. However, empowerment design requires going beyond the initial site of innovation, and therefore we also bring in data based on our work with teachers and additional sites so as to communicate the complete cycle of empowerment design.

@article{Akre2011,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: After only six months, a commerce-free internet-based milk-sharing model is operating in nearly 50 countries, connecting mothers who are able to donate breast milk with the caregivers of babies who need breast milk. Some public health authorities have condemned this initiative out of hand. Although women have always shared their milk, in many settings infant formula has become the "obvious" alternative to a mother's own milk. Yet an internationally endorsed recommendation supports mother-to-mother milk sharing as the best option in place of a birth mother's milk. Why then this rejection? Several possibilities come to mind: 1) ignorance and prejudice surrounding shared breast milk; 2) a perceived challenge to the medical establishment of a system where mothers exercise independent control; and 3) concern that mother-to-mother milk sharing threatens donor milk banks. We are not saying that milk sharing is risk-free or that the internet is an ideal platform for promoting it. Rather, we are encouraging health authorities to examine this initiative closely, determine what is happening, and provide resources to make mother-to-mother milk sharing as safe as possible. Health authorities readily concede that life is fraught with risk; accordingly, they promote risk-reduction and harm-minimisation strategies. Why should it be any different for babies lacking their own mothers' milk? The more that is known about the risks of substituting for breast milk, the more reasonable parental choice to use donor milk becomes. We believe that the level of intrinsic risk is manageable through informed sharing. If undertaken, managed and evaluated appropriately, this made-by-mothers model shows considerable potential for expanding the world's supply of human milk and improving the health of children.},

We performed a search of published articles on the topic in PubMed and SciELO from 2000 to 2012. Additionally, references of selected studies were included. We found that bad news is a difficult task for physicians associated with discomfort, anxiety and stress. There is a consensus on the need for more training in this area. It was also described is that patients and their families are dissatisfied with the way health professionals communicate information, especially related to bad news. Individual reactions depend on a number of factors such as personality, religious beliefs, support from other family and friends, previous experiences, expectations, cultural context and how this news was broadcast. Some studies have described the parents' opinion on how it was and how it should be the family-doctor communication.},

We describe legal norms for child consent to health-related interventions in South Africa, and argue that the South African parliament has taken an inconsistent approach to: the capacity of children to consent; the persons able to consent when children do not have capacity; and restrictions on the autonomy of children or their proxies to consent. In addition, the rationale for the differing age limitations, capacity requirements and public policy restrictions has not been specified. These inconsistencies make it difficult for stakeholders interacting with children to ensure that they act lawfully.},

Human-computer interaction researchers have devoted resources on studying how to design such tools.

However, such strategies are developed with an assumption that the targeted consumer of information is the one directly manipulating user interfaces of the system that has information. This may not always be the case for users in developing regions. As a result, such systems may not scale well in contexts where a targeted consumer (beneficiary) may use technology through the facilitation of another person (intermediary) whom is responsible for manipulating user interfaces, because such facilitators are not recognized as part of the system, hence motivational strategies don't cater for them. In order to uncover design implications for intermediated technology use in the context of personal health informatics (PHI), the researcher started with the theoretical framing of the work followed by a contextual enquiry which led to development of mobile applications' prototypes for tracking nutrition and physical activity. Evaluation of the prototypes revealed that a familial relationship is a prerequisite for such an intervention. The most promising combination involves family members, possibly a child and a parent working together. The study used self-determination theory to understand how a collaborative gamified system can increase engagement. The result revealed that gamification as the source of a significant increase in perceived competence in intermediary users whom also tended to consider themselves as co-owners of the interaction experience. Therefore, gamification was found to be a catalyst for increasing collaboration between an intermediary and beneficiary user of technology, provided that the two users that formed a pair had a prior social relationship. In the absence of gamification, intermediary users tended to be less engaged in the intervention. The study highlights both the positive and negative aspects of gamification in promoting collaboration in intermediated use and its general implications in health settings. Design considerations required in order to improve the overall user experience of both users involved are proposed. In general, this work contributes to both theory and empirical validation of factors for, supporting proximate-enabled intermediated use of personal health informatics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of a transitional care intervention delivered by advanced practice nurses (APNs) to elders hospitalized with heart failure. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with follow-up through 52 weeks postindex hospital discharge. SETTING: Six Philadelphia academic and community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-nine eligible patients were aged 65 and older and hospitalized with heart failure. INTERVENTION: A 3-month APN-directed discharge planning and home follow-up protocol. MEASUREMENTS: Time to first rehospitalization or death, number of rehospitalizations, quality of life, functional status, costs, and satisfaction with care. RESULTS: Mean age of patients (control n=121; intervention n=118) enrolled was 76; 43{\%} were male, and 36{\%} were African American. Time to first readmission or death was longer in intervention patients (log rank chi(2)=5.0, P=.026; Cox regression incidence density ratio=1.65, 95{\%} confidence interval=1.13-2.40). At 52 weeks, intervention group patients had fewer readmissions (104 vs 162, P=.047) and lower mean total costs ({\$}7,636 vs {\$}12,481, P=.002). For intervention patients, only short-term improvements were demonstrated in overall quality of life (12 weeks, P{\textless}.05), physical dimension of quality of life (2 weeks, P{\textless}.01; 12 weeks, P{\textless}.05) and patient satisfaction (assessed at 2 and 6 weeks, P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSION: A comprehensive transitional care intervention for elders hospitalized with heart failure increased the length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death, reduced total number of rehospitalizations, and decreased healthcare costs, thus demonstrating great promise for improving clinical and economic outcomes.},

abstract = {Idea generation (ideation) is critical to the design and marketing of new products, to marketing strategy, and to the creation of effective advertising copy. However, there has been relatively little formal research on the underlying incentives with which to encourage participants to focus their energies on relevant and novel ideas. Several problems have been identified with traditional ideation methods. For example, participants often free ride on other participants' efforts because rewards are typically based on the group-level output of ideation sessions. This paper examines whether carefully tailored ideation incentives can improve creative output. I begin by studying the influence of incentives on idea generation using a formal model of the ideation process. This model illustrates the effect of rewarding participants for their impact on the group and identifies a parameter that mediates this effect. I then develop a practical, web-based asynchronous "ideation game," which allows the implementation and test of various incentive schemes. Using this system, I run two experiments that demonstrate that incentives do have the capability to improve idea generation, confirm the predictions from the theoretical analysis, and provide additional insight on the mechanisms of ideation.},

Despite being one of the most frequently used qualitative research methodologies in educational research, the methodologists do not have a full consensus on the design and implementation of case study, which hampers its full evolution. Focusing on the landmark works of three prominent methodologists, namely Robert Yin, Sharan Merriam, Robert Stake, I attempt to scrutinize the areas where their perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. I aim to help the emerging researchers in the field of education familiarize themselves with the diverse views regarding case study that lead to a vast array of techniques and strategies, out of which they can come up with a combined perspective which best serves their research purpose.},

This article overviews the historical relationship between HCI and international development, compares their disciplinary approaches, and suggests that both sides would gain from ongoing interaction. Inter- national development could benefit from HCI's broad methodological tools, which include qualitative and quantitative research methods, design through iterative prototyping, and reflective inquiry. HCI could benefit from international development's exposure to a broader base of cultures, sectors, and concerns. These issues are discussed with specific examples from published papers and several well-known projects that apply HCI to development.

Identifying components of their role and recognising the elements within the nursery that obstruct or encourage this role can allow for modification of nurse education and peer support.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Qualitative study based on semistructured interviews.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Nine neonatal nurses from a single neonatal intensive care unit were interviewed and the data analysed thematically using nvivo version 10.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants viewed their role as an enjoyable yet difficult one, requiring seniority, training and experience. They provided support to parents by communicating, listening, providing individualised support and by encouraging parental involvement with their baby. Constructive elements that contributed to the provision of support included a positive neonatal intensive care unit environment and providing a parent support group. More obstructive elements were a lack of physical neonatal intensive care unit space, little time available for nurse-to-parent conversation and language and cultural barriers between nurses and parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The role of the neonatal nurse in providing emotional support is complex and requires a high level of ongoing support and education for staff, and minimisation of physical and staff-related obstructions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The modern neonatal intensive care unit offers complex medical and nursing services and with this care comes higher needs from both babies and their parents. Neonatal intensive care unit nurses should be supported in their roles by having peer support available in the neonatal intensive care unit and education and training in emotional support and counselling skills.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, incidence, and correlates of HIV-1 infection in a cohort of east African trucking company employees. METHODS: HIV-1-seronegative trucking company employees were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and evaluated at 3 monthly intervals for HIV-1 seroconversion, sexually transmitted diseases, and sexual behavior. RESULTS: The baseline seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 1500 trucking company employees was 17.8{\%}. Among 752 HIV-1-seronegative men who were followed, the HIV-1 annual seroincidence was 3.1{\%}. In univariate analysis, HIV-1 acquisition was associated with age under 25 years, 10 years or less of sexual activity, occupation as a driver/driver's assistant, occupational travel for more than 14 days per month, religion other than Christian or Muslim, uncircumcised status, sex with a prostitute, sex with a girlfriend/casual partner, extramarital sex, and enrollment seropositivity to Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Herpes simplex virus type 2 (all P values {\textless} or = 0.05). Using multivariate analysis, HIV-1 acquisition was independently associated with 10 years or less of sexual activity (hazard rate ratio (HRR) 2.0, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.0-4.3), occupation as a driver/driver's assistant (HRR 3.9, 95{\%} CI 1.7-9.0), religion other than Christian or Muslim (HRR 6.1, 95{\%} CI 1.4-25.7), uncircumcised status (HRR 2.3, 95{\%} CI 1.0-5.0), and unprotected sex with a prostitute (HRR 2.8, 95{\%} CI 1.1-7.0). CONCLUSIONS: Trucking company employees had a high HIV-1 seroprevalence rate at enrollment and a high HIV-1 seroincidence during follow-up. Risk factors for HIV-1 seroconversion included years of sexual activity, occupation, religion, uncircumcised status, and unprotected sex with a prostitute. This population is an appropriate target for HIV-1 prevention trials and behavioral interventions.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was assessment of hospital costs of 211 preterm babies admitted to NICU in a 12-month period. Methods: Preterm babies with gestational age 28-37 GW hospitalized in Dr. L. Ki{\{}dotless{\}}rdar Kartal Research and Training Hospital NICU between November 1st, 2006 to October 31st, 2007 were included in this retrospective study. The financial records of the babies were plotted and investigational, interventional, consumable costs, drugs and ancillary costs were determined. The average daily cost of a preterm has been determined. Group I and II consisted of babies with gestational ages 37-33 GW and 32-28 GWs respectively. The length of stay, ventilation duration and costs of each group were compared. Findings: The mean birth weight was 1689+/-497 gr. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.6+/-13.4 days. Hundred and four (49,5{\%}) patients were found to be ventilated. The median ventilation day was 3 days. We found a statistically significant relation between length of hospital stay, ventilation duration, presence of intervention, RDS, sepsis and hospital costs. The mean total hospitalization cost and the daily cost of a preterm was determined as {\$}4187 and {\$}303 respectively. The highest intensive care costs of preterm neonates were found to be paid for interventional procedures, followed by NICU personnel salary and ancillary costs. Between two groups statistically significant difference was found for length of stay, duration of ventilation, interventional and consumable costs (P=0.014, P=0.019, P=0,001, P=0.03 respectively). Conclusion: Strategies for prevention of prematurity and early weaning from mechanical ventilation may shorten length of hospital stay leading to decreased NICU costs. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract = {Most mobile health (mHealth) programmes are designed with minimal input from target end users and are not truly personalised or adaptive to their specific and evolving needs. This review describes the methods and processes used in the co-design of mHealth interventions. Nine relevant studies of varying design were identified following searches of six academic databases. All employed co-design or participatory methods for the development of a health intervention delivered via a mobile device, with three focusing on health behaviour change (one on nutrition) and six on management of a health condition. Overall, six key phases of design and 17 different methods were used. Sufficiency of reporting was poor, and no study undertook a robust assessment of efficacy; these factors should be a focus for future studies. An opportunity exists to use co-design methods to develop acceptable and feasible mHealth interventions, especially to support improved nutrition and for minority and indigenous groups.

abstract = {This paper reports on research carried out in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) on the interaction between a human and a mobile device, in the specific case where a healthcare professional uses the mobile device to access a medical application. The quality of mobile user interface is crucial in the healthcare domain, as the attention of healthcare professionals is usually on the patient and not on the system, and so low-quality UIs may lead to critical medical errors. In this research, the quality-in-use measurement model (QiU-4-MUI) is used to empirically investigate the impact of HCI principles on the quality of an MUI, in terms of five important characteristics, namely, effectiveness, productivity, efficiency, error safety, and cognitive load. The work investigates the applicability of these quality characteristics as indicators of the impact on user interface design of HCI principles, such as mental model, metaphor, feedback, affordance, and visibility. A controlled experiment was carried out among 23 doctors in a hospital environment to empirically investigate the impact of HCI principles on the quality in use of a mobile user interface, in terms of the QiU-4-MUI characteristics and in the healthcare context.},

More specifically, we aimed 1) to identify groups of parents in the NICU who are particularly at risk of experiencing stress, and 2) to explore the effects of clinical staffs' communication on parental stress. Methods: Our multi-center-study evaluated views from 1277 parents about care for 923 infants in 66 German NICUs. Answers were linked with separately evaluated medical outcomes of the infants. Separate generalised mixed models estimated the influence of personal, medical and communication-related characteristics on specific parental stress. Results: Parents of a younger age and those of infants with severe prognoses were more likely to experience stress. While empathetic communication as one aspect of staffs' communication was shown as appropriate in reducing parental stress, an initial introduction and the quantity of information were only slightly associated with lower levels of stress. Conclusion: Results provide evidence for the need to involve parents empathetically from the beginning of their child's stay in the NICU. Practice implications: Staff in the NICU should communicate empathetically and help to reduce stress in parents particularly at risk.},

We arrange these findings into nine guiding principles aimed at helping those who are searching for effective approaches for design for the developing world. The findings reviewed come from the mechanical engineering discipline, as well as from other engineering and nonengineering disciplines. For each principle, we provide references to various studies as a means of supporting the principle. We also provide a detailed example of each principle. Based on our own experience and based on the many papers reviewed, we provide a succinct list of suggestions for using each principle. Finally, we relate these nine principles to traditional design principles. Ultimately, we believe that the principles introduced here help overcome the challenges of design for the developing world, which are often dominated by designer unfamiliarity with poverty and foreign culture and the constraint of extreme affordability.},

This paper highlights considerations for co-design researchers and practitioners interested in enhancing the value created through co-design. The authors draw from discussions in transformative service research (TSR) to better understand how co-design influences well-being. Co-design is defined as a process of joint inquiry and imagination where diverse actors share and combine their knowledge. Based on the broad definition of service set out in service- dominant logic (SDL), the authors take the position that co-design is a form of service and therefore stress the relevance of TSR to co-design. The paper identifies six dimensions of well-being discussed in TSR that extend and highlight gaps in co-design literature related to the influence of the co-design process on well-being. The authors suggest that these dimensions become a component of future evaluations of the co-design process and point to opportunities for further research related to how co-design influences well-being and supports transformation.},

abstract = {MomConnect is a flagship programme of the South African National Department of Health that has reached over 1.5 million pregnant women. Using mobile technology, MomConnect provides pregnant and postpartum women with twice-weekly health information text messages as well as access to a helpdesk for patient queries and feedback. In just 3 years, MomConnect has been taken to scale to reach over 95{\%} of public health facilities and has reached 63{\%} of all pregnant women attending their first antenatal appointment. The helpdesk has received over 300 000 queries at an average of 250 per day from 6{\%} of MomConnect users. The service is entirely free to its users. The rapid deployment of MomConnect has been facilitated by strong government leadership, and an ecosystem of mobile health implementers who had experience of much of the content and technology required. An early decision to design MomConnect for universal coverage has required the use of text-based technologies (short messaging service and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) that are accessible via even the most basic mobile phones, but cumbersome to use and costly at scale. Unlike previous mobile messaging services in South Africa, MomConnect collects the user's identification number and facility code during registration, enabling future linkages with other health and population databases and geolocated feedback. MomConnect has catalysed additional efforts to strengthen South Africa's digital health architecture. The rapid growth in smartphone penetration presents new opportunities to reduce costs, increase real-time data collection and expand the reach and scope of MomConnect to serve health workers and other patient groups.},

Steered by such visions, they have innovated devices and services exploring the value of alternative propositions with and for individuals, groups and communities. Meanwhile, such radical and long-term explorations are uncommon for what have been termed emergent users; users, that is, for whom advanced technologies are just within grasp. Rather, a driving assumption is that today's high-end mobile technologies will “trickle down” to these user groups in due course. In this paper, we open the debate about what mobile technologies might be like if emergent users were directly involved in creating their visions for the future 5–10 years from now. To do this, we report on a set of envisioning workshops in India, South Africa and Kenya that provide a roadmap for valued, effective devices and services for these regions in the next decade.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The design of bespoke training addressing domain-specific job roles and relations presents a particular challenge. Using the concept of data-in-place where data is understood as being bound and produced by a particular place, this paper describes how locally-situated accounts can be used to engage employees in workplace-specific training seminars. Using higher education as a case study, we describe a four-stage design process for future training efforts: (1) in-depth interviews for further understanding of bullying and harassment; (2) design of digital probes for capturing contextual data; (3) probe deployment and subsequent data analysis; (4) data-driven discussion-based seminars. We outline the potential for digital probes in promoting the denormalization of toxic workplace cultures, considerations for novel sensitive data governance models, and the discussion of data-in-place's temporal dimension.},

It aims to provide a better definition of Interaction Design that encompasses the intellectual facets of the field and the particular methods used by practitioners in their day-to-day experiences. It also attempts to provide Interaction Designers with the vocabulary necessary to justify their existence to other team members. The book positions Interaction Design in a way that emphasizes the intellectual facets of the discipline. It discusses the role of language, argument, and rhetoric in the design of products, services, and systems. It examines various academic approaches to thinking about Design, and concludes that the Designer is a liberal artist left to infuse empathy in technologically driven products. The book also examines the tools and techniques used by practitioners. These include methods for structuring large quantities of data, ways of thinking about users, and approaches for thinking about human behavior as it unfolds over time. Finally, it introduces the idea of Interaction Design as an integral facet of the business development process. First book to provide a solid definition and framework for the booming field of interaction design, finally giving designers the justification needed to prove their essential role on every development team Provides designers with tools they need to operate effectively in the workplace without compromising their goals: making useable, useful, and desirable products Outlines process, theory, practice, and challenges of interaction design - intertwined with real world stories from a variety of perspectives.},

abstract = {The Workers Solidarity Movement was founded in Dub-lin, Ireland in 1984 following discussions by a number of local anarchist groups on the need for a national anarchist organisation. At that time with unemployment and inequality on the rise, there seemed every reason to argue for anarchism and for a revolutionary change in Irish society. This has not changed. Like most socialists we share a fundamental belief that capitalism is the problem. We believe that as a system it must be ended, that the wealth of society should be commonly owned and that its resources should be used to serve the needs of humanity as a whole and not those of a small greedy minority. But, just as impor-tantly, we see this struggle against capitalism as also being a struggle for freedom. We believe that socialism and freedom must go together, that we cannot have one without the other. Anarchism has always stood for individual freedom. But it also stands for democracy. We believe in democratis-ing the workplace and in workers taking control of all industry. We believe that this is the only real alternative to capitalism with its ongoing reliance on hierarchy and oppression and its depletion of the world's resources.},

Alongside this move into complex "real life" settings there is growing interest in the ethical challenges HCI researchers encounter, the emotional impact research can have on participants and researchers, and the risk that new technologies might exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, existing vulnerabilities. Some authors have called for researchers to openly reflect about ethical challenges so we can learn from shared experiences. Others have warned that HCI researchers may not be sufficiently equipped to understand and respond to the needs of vulnerable participants. This paper documents cases of "sensitive HCI," drawing on research conducted in diverse sensitive settings. By reflecting on common challenges and discussing possible responses we contribute to growing discourse that promotes reflexive practice in sensitive HCI.},

Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

Findings revealed that parents with an infant in the NICU experience depression, anxiety, stress, and loss of control, and they vacillate between feelings of inclusion and exclusion related to the provision of health care to their neonate. Nursing interventions that promote positive psychosocial outcomes are needed to decrease parental feelings of stress, anxiety, and loss of control.

We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 23 participants in Kenya. Our field study makes current feedback practices visible; and reveals barriers faced by beneficiaries, community health workers, and their supervisors. Our findings identify relevant socio-technical complexities, and we outline concrete opportunities to design feedback systems that support and augment current practices. These contributions to the ICTD literature hold potential to inform the design of feedback systems that engage underserved populations in a systematic and equitable manner.},

This paper reports on four phases of a design and research project, from sensitising user-engagement and user-centred design, to the development and in-the-wild deployment of a mobile phone application called FeedFinder. FeedFinder has been developed with breastfeeding women to support them in finding, reviewing and sharing public breastfeeding places with other breastfeeding women.

One of the largest funders, the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), makes it clear that it values the knowledge of patients and the public. As a result, there are now many resources to make sure that the public voice is included in decision-making about research. However, there is concern that the public voice still has limited impact on research decision-making. This article asks to what extent has power shifted from the scientific research community to the public? It looks at how much power and impact patients and members of the public have about research by asking: How do the public contribute to deciding which research areas and which research projects should be funded? How do they influence how the research is carried out? The article argues that there is evidence that the public voice is present in research decision-making. However, there is less evidence of a change in the power dynamic between the scientific research community and the public. The public involved in research are not always equal partners. The scientific research community still has the loudest voice and patients and the public do not always feel sufficiently empowered to challenge it.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Maternal and neonatal mortality remains high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Availability and use of mobile phones is increasing rapidly with 90{\%} of persons in developing countries having a mobile-cellular subscription. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proposed as effective solutions to improve maternal and neonatal health. This systematic review assessed the effect of mHealth interventions that support pregnant women during the antenatal, birth and postnatal period in LMIC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The review was registered with Prospero (CRD42014010292). Six databases were searched from June 2014-April 2015, accompanied by grey literature search using pre-defined search terms linked to pregnant women in LMIC and mHealth. Quality of articles was assessed with an adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Because of heterogeneity in outcomes, settings and study designs a narrative synthesis of quantitative results of intervention studies on maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes, service utilization, and healthy pregnancy education was conducted. Qualitative and quantitative results were synthesized with a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 3777 articles were found, of which 27 studies were included: twelve intervention studies and fifteen descriptive studies. mHealth interventions targeted at pregnant women increased maternal and neonatal service utilization shown through increased antenatal care attendance, facility-service utilization, skilled attendance at birth, and vaccination rates. Few articles assessed the effect on maternal or neonatal health outcomes, with inconsistent results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: mHealth interventions may be effective solutions to improve maternal and neonatal service utilization. Further studies assessing mHealth's impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes are recommended. The emerging trend of strong experimental research designs with randomized controlled trials, combined with feasibility research, government involvement and integration of mHealth interventions into the healthcare system is encouraging and can pave the way to improved decision making on best practice implementation of mHealth interventions.},

Fuzzy logic, a mathematical approach to computing, extends the traditional binary “true or false” (one or zero) to exemplify this notion of partial truths that lies between completely true and false. The commentary explores health, socio-ecological and environmental consequences–positive, neutral or negative. Of particular significance is the negative influence of mHealth on maternal care-behaviors, which can increase stress reactivity and vulnerability to stress-induced illness across the lifespan of the child and establish pathways for intergenerational transmission of behaviors. A mHealth “fingerprinting” approach is essential to monitor psychosocial, economic, cultural, environmental and physical impact of mHealth intervention and make evidence-informed decision(s) about use of mHealth in maternal and newborn care.},

HCI is practiced all over the world, and within Euro-American contexts, HCI research is also increasingly turning its attention to real world settings, outside of the controlled environments of the usability lab. One increasingly popular approach to designing and evaluating new technologies in real-world settings is called ‘in the wild' research. We find this terminology uncomfortable from an African perspective as it evokes negative connotations of the contexts in which we study and the people we study with. Our intention is not to discredit this approach but rather to start a conversation around the terminologies we use to describe our research approaches and contexts. We consider it an ethical imperative to be conscious of the words we use to describe people and places, not only as HCI research expands its empirical focus to real world settings, but equally importantly to support HCI research beyond its traditional centres in Europe or America.},

During the study period, videos were viewed at an average of 170 times per month, for a total of 2898 views. Through this data we draw these primary findings: a) pausing is not contextually necessary, b) age is not a barrier to usage, c) the primary predictor of popularity of a given video is topical relevance and national campaigns, d) there is no apparent relationship between video length, popularity and completion rates, and e) new videos have only a short-lived novelty effect. Furthermore, we affirm that regular engagement with CHWs has an impact on continued usage, in addition to being important for reducing attrition due to technical issues.},

abstract = {Objective: to investigate whether pregnant Swedish women used the Internet to retrieve pregnancy-related information, how they perceived the reliability of the information, and whether they discussed this information with their midwife during antenatal care visits. Design and setting: a descriptive, cross-sectional design using waiting-room questionnaires to obtain information from pregnant women attending 11 antenatal clinics in a county in mid-Sweden during 2004. Participants: all Swedish-speaking women who visited the clinics during a 2-week period, and who were at least 32 weeks pregnant, were invited to participate. A total of 182 women, with a mean age of 31 years, participated in the study; the response rate 85{\%}. Findings: most (91{\%}) of the women had access to the Internet and, to a great extent (84{\%}), used it to retrieve information, most often in the early stages of their pregnancy. Fetal development and stages of childbirth were the two most often mentioned topics of interest. Most participants considered the information to be reliable, and the two most important criteria for judging the trustworthiness of web-based information were if the facts were consistent with information from other sources and if references were provided. Most (70{\%}) of the women did not discuss the information they had retrieved from the Internet with their midwife, but more than half of them (55{\%}) searched for information on topics brought up by the midwife. Conclusion: Swedish pregnant women often use the Internet to find information on various topics related to pregnancy, childbirth and the expected baby. They perceive the information to be reliable but rarely discuss it with their midwives. Antenatal care providers should be able to guide pregnant women to high-quality, web-based information and then take the opportunity to discuss this information with them during antenatal visits. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Over recent years, there have been increasing opportunities for inhabitants of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to use information and communication technologies (ICT). ICT can potentially help LMICs tackle a wide range of health, social and economic problems. By improving access to information and enabling communication, ICT can play a role in achieving millennium development goals (MDGs) such as the elimination of extreme poverty, combating serious diseases, and accomplishing universal primary education. This study is aimed at examining the nature and extent of impact of ICT on poverty reduction in LMICs. A specific focus is developed for the health sector, elucidating which support ICT may provide to reduce inequalities and strengthen health systems in LMICs. In addition, present EU actions in the area of improving ICT diffusion in LMICs are assessed. Building on three literature reviews, the study first describes the conditions hampering or facilitating the support of ICT to poverty reduction in LMICs, then focuses on the specific opportunities and obstacles in the use of ICT in the healthcare sector and, finally, it illustrates the EU policy approach for promoting ICT in LMICs. Evidence from desk analysis is complemented by the opinions of 145 surveyed experts, ten of which were also interviewed. Experts' opinions confirm the evidence of desk analysis pointing to health and education as the main areas in which ICT can play a significant role in LMICs development. Building upon the evidence collected, the study provides policy options for future action which the EU could undertake to help LMICs profit from all the opportunities that ICT offer.},

These benefits are related to improving the creative process, the service, project management, or longer-term effects. We propose that the people involved in co-design first identify the goals of the service design project and then align their co-design activities, and the associated benefits, to these goals.

abstract = {Developing countries are faced with the daunting challenge of lowering their neonate and child mortality rates. Studies have indicated that up to 13{\%} of the deaths of children under the age of five could be prevented by breastfeeding alone. One key barrier is the availability of breast milk for vulnerable infants (those born pre-term, with low birth-weight, to HIV-positive mothers, or orphaned at birth). One strategy to increase availability of breast milk is establishing human milk banks that process donor milk. However, it has been difficult to provide safe, pasteurized donor breast milk to infants in developing countries due to cost and lack of infrastructure. Low-cost pasteurization methods require rigorous temperature monitoring and quality assurance processes for adoption at scale. In this paper, we present an affordable system to monitor breast milk pasteurization. It leverages mobile and sensing technologies to enhance an existing, low-cost pasteurization method called flash heat pasteurization. A mobile application, running on an Android phone that is connected to a temperature probe, monitors milk temperatures during pasteurization, and provides audiovisual feedback to guide users performing the procedure. At the end of the procedure, users are able to print a pasteurization report, and labels for pasteurized milk jars from the mobile application. The pasteurization temperature curve is also uploaded to a server that enables supervisors to remotely review procedures and perform audits to ensure that procedures are being performed correctly. We discuss the lessons learned from ongoing deployments at two locations in Durban, South Africa. To date they have processed microbial assays for 40 donor milk samples in which 31 samples showed microbial activity pre-pasteurization, while none of the post-pasteurized samples show any microbial growth. We are currently working with the Human Milk Banking Association of South Africa to scale up the use of the system to more sites. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

@phdthesis{Schneider2018a,
abstract = {Technology bears the potential to empower people - to help them tackle challenges they would otherwise give up on or not even try, to make experiences possible they did not have access to before. One type of such technologies - the application area of this thesis - is health and wellbeing technology (HWT), such as digital health records, physical activity trackers, or digital fitness coach applications. HWTs often claim to empower people to live health- ier and happier lives. However, there is reason to challenge and critically reflect on these claims and underlying assumptions as more and more researchers are finding that technolo- gies aiming or claiming to be empowering often turn out to be disempowering. This critical reflection is the starting point of this thesis: Can HWTs really empower people in their ev- eryday lives? If so, how should we go about designing them to foster empowerment and avoid disempowerment? To this aim, this thesis makes three main contributions: First, it presents a framework of empowering technologies that aims to introduce concep- tual and terminological clarity of empowerment in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As a literature review conducted for this thesis reveals, the understandings of empow- erment in HCI diverge substantially, rendering the term a subsumption of diverse research endeavors. The presented framework is informed by the results of the literature review as well as prior work on empowerment in social sciences, psychology, and philosophy. It aims to help other researchers to analyze conceptual differences between their own work and oth- ers' and to position their research projects. In the same way, this thesis uses the proposed framework to analyze and reflect on the conducted case studies. Second, this thesis explores how HWT can empower people in a number of studies. Tech- nologies that are investigated in these studies are divided into three interaction paradigms (derived from Beaudouin-Lafon's interaction paradigms): Technologies that follow the computer-as-tool paradigm include patient-controlled electronic health records, and phys- ical activity trackers; technologies in the computer-as-partner paradigm include personal- ized digital fitness coaches; and technologies in the computer-as-intelligent-tool paradigm includes transparently designed digital coaching technology. For each of these paradigms, I discuss benefits and shortcomings, as well as recommendations for future work. Third, I explore methods for designing and evaluating empowering technology. Therefore, I analyze and discuss methods that have been used in the different case studies to inform the design of empowering technologies such as interviews, observations, personality tests, experience sampling, or the Theory of Planned Behavior. Further, I present the design and evaluation of two tools that aimed to help researchers and designers evaluate empowering technologies by eliciting rich, contextualized feedback from users and fostering an empathic relationship between users and designers. I hope that my framework, design explorations, and evaluation tools will serve research on empowering technologies in HCI to develop a more grounded understanding, a clear research agenda, and inspire the development of a new class of empowering HWTs.},

It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable for the evaluation of screen shots of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned screen shots. In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based screen shots and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70{\%} of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based screen shots of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement.},

abstract = {Robots are becoming increasingly prevailing to children's everyday life. They have been introduced as facilitators for the learning process in formal education, as social partners for children's free play in dynamic settings or as tools to enrich therapeutic methods for children on autism spectrum. Despite the benefits that they seem to have on children's development, they can be social forces which may affect children's self-conceptions, their social interactions or interactions with the surroundings. In each case robots have an ethical significance which should be taken into consideration by designers, researchers and practitioners, in particular when focusing on intentional relations. This position paper supports that children's inclusion to the design process is inherently an ethical activity and it could be considered as one of the tools towards children's development of awareness about robots. This would also contribute to a value-centric design approach by considering the very user and the ways children perceive and interpret robots and their intentions. Consequently, we believe that this approach opens the possibilities for children to have an active role when they interact with robots in various settings.

However, empowerment theories were developed prior to the Internet and fail to account for the speed and scale that people can find one another online. One domain where empowerment is critical is caring for children with special needs, in which parents are required to navigate a complex maze of services and processes to access care for their child. We conducted 43 interviews with parents of children with special needs to investigate whether using social media sites helps them to perform this caregiving work. Critically, parents are able to do this through almost real-time access to other parents on Facebook. This work introduces the concept of networked empowerment, that describes how parents find other parents, access resources, and explore new ways for promoting health advocacy among caregivers at a local and national level. We conclude with design implications for facilitating faster and better access to information and support for caregivers.},

Communication between parents and NICU staff is an essential part of the support offered to the parents and can reduce their emotional stress. The aim of this study was to describe parents¿ experiences of communication with NICU staff.MethodsA hermeneutic lifeworld interview study was performed with 18 families whose children were treated in the level III NICU at a university hospital in Sweden. The interviews were analysed to gain an interpretation of the phenomenon of how parents in the NICU experienced their communication with the staff, in order to find new ways to understand their experience.ResultsParents¿ experience of communication with the staff during their infant¿s stay at the NICU can be described by the main theme `being given attention or ignored in their emotional situation¿. The main theme derives from three themes; (1) meeting a fellow human being, (2) being included or excluded as a parent and (3) bearing unwanted responsibility.ConclusionsThis study shows that parents experienced communication with the NICU staff as essential to their management of their situation. Attentive communication gives the parents relief in their trying circumstances. In contrast, lack of communication contributes to feelings of loneliness, abandonment and unwanted responsibility, which adds to the burden of an already difficult situation. The level of communication in meetings with staff can have a decisive influence on parents¿ experiences of the NICU.The staff should thus be reminded of their unique position to help parents handle their emotional difficulties. The organization should facilitate opportunities for good communication between parents and staff through training, staffing and the physical health care environment.},

Although KMC is a key intervention package in newborn health initiatives, there is limited systematic information available on the barriers to KMC practice that mothers and other stakeholders face while practicing KMC. This systematic review sought to identify the most frequently reported barriers to KMC practice for mothers, fathers, and health practitioners, as well as the most frequently reported enablers to practice for mothers. We searched nine electronic databases and relevant reference lists for publications reporting barriers or enablers to KMC practice. We identified 1,264 unique publications, of which 103 were included based on pre-specified criteria. Publications were scanned for all barriers / enablers. Each publication was also categorized based on its approach to identification of barriers / enablers, and more weight was assigned to publications which had systematically sought to understand factors influencing KMC practice. Four of the top five ranked barriers to KMC practice for mothers were resource-related: "Issues with the facility environment / resources," "negative impressions of staff attitudes or interactions with staff," "lack of help with KMC practice or other obligations," and "low awareness of KMC / infant health." Considering only publications from low- and middle-income countries, "pain / fatigue" was ranked higher than when considering all publications. Top enablers to practice were included "mother-infant attachment" and "support from family, friends, and other mentors." Our findings suggest that mother can understand and enjoy KMC, and it has benefits for mothers, infants, and families. However, continuous KMC may be physically and emotionally difficult, and often requires support from family members, health practitioners, or other mothers. These findings can serve as a starting point for researchers and program implementers looking to improve KMC programs.},

abstract = {Research shows that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to economic growth and social development of communities. However, in rural areas there are challenges that appear to slow down the progress and the realisation of the impact of ICTs. These ICT challenges include poor infrastructure, technological illiteracy, high costs of ICTs etc. An assessment of ICT challenges within rural areas was done. A composite methodological approach was employed in this study. This involved the use of qualitative research techniques such as participant observation, workshops, focus groups and individual interviews supported by document analysis. The Siyakhula Living Lab (SLL) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa was used as the case study. The paper aims to identify an association between the ICT challenges based on rural ICT users and ICT experts. Two study groups were selected i.e. rural users within SLL, ICT experts in Europe and Africa, government officials and academic institutions were engaged to understand the current ICT challenges in rural areas. Each of the study groups had 50 participants. Chi-square tests were used to test the level of association between each of the challenges. Results show that there are variations in identifying current ICT challenges between SLL rural users and ICT experts. ICT experts mentioned poor ICT infrastructure as the main challenge while this was not what SLL rural users thought. Rather, the SLL community pointed technological illiteracy as the main challenge. The paper aims to show the degree on how each of the ICT challenge was viewed by each of the study groups.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of the willingness of patients with diabetes to use a self-management tool based on information and communication technology (ICT) such as personal computers, smartphones, and mobile phones; and to examine the patient characteristics associated with that willingness., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional interview survey of 312 adults with diabetes at a university hospital in an urban area in Japan. Participants were classified into 2 groups: those who were willing to use an ICT-based self-management tool and those who were unwilling. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the willingness, including clinical and social factors, current use of ICT, self-management practices, self-efficacy, and diabetes-related emotional distress., RESULTS: The mean age of the 312 participants was 66.3 years (SD=11.5) and 198 (63{\%}) were male. Most of the participants (93{\%}) had type 2 diabetes. Although only 51 (16{\%}) currently used ICT-based self-management tools, a total of 157 (50{\%}) expressed the willingness to use such a tool. Factors associated with the willingness included: not having nephropathy (OR=2.02, 95{\%} CI 1.14 to 3.58); outpatient visits once a month or more (vs less than once a month, OR=2.13, 95{\%} CI 1.13 to 3.99); current use of personal computers and/or smartphones (OR=4.91, 95{\%} CI 2.69 to 8.98); and having greater diabetes-related emotional distress (OR=1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.20)., CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the patients showed interest in using an ICT-based self-management tool. Willing patients may expect ICT-based self-management tools to complement outpatient visits and to make self-management easier. Starting with patients who display the willingness factors might optimize programs based on such tools.},

abstract = {Participatory approaches to information systems design have evolved over approximately the last three decades, mainly in Scandinavia, Europe, and lately in the US. However there has been limited and peripheral research and debates over participatory design approaches and techniques in developing country settings. This paper explores three case studies in developing countries where participatory approaches have been used in the design and implementation of health information systems. The investigation reveals the politics of design, the nature of participation, and the methods, tools and techniques for carrying out design projects are shaped with respect to the diversity of the socio-economic, cultural and political situations faced in each of these settings. Though common strategies, such as capacity development, could be found that cut across the three case studies it is the importance of the contextual nature of participatory design that emerges most strongly. There is no single algorithmic best practice regarding participatory design in information systems which is applicable to all situations.},

abstract = {What are the best ways for design teams attend to issues of power, inequity, trust and other ethical concerns as they arise in design? Literature on value-sensitive design (VSD) and technology ethics has advocated for a range of design methods that propose different roles and responsibility for ethics during technology development. This paper explores four provocations that imagine different roles and responsibilities for moral and ethical reasoning on design teams: participatory design (in which diverse stakeholders may represent their own values in the design process), values advocates (introducing experts to lead values discussions or conduct ethics interventions), embedding values discussions within design and encouraging 'moral exemplars' within design. Each of these posits different logistical arrangements as well as different levels of expertise in ethical practice. The paper uses examples from the VSD and computer ethics literatures as well as the authors' ethnographic work to explore the advantages, challenges and consequences of each approach. {\textcopyright} The Author 2016.

abstract = {The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a high-stress environment for both families and health care providers that can sometimes make appropriate medical decisions challenging. We present a review article of non-medical barriers to effective decision making in the NICU, including: miscommunication, mixed messages, denial, comparative social and cultural influences, and the possible influence of perceived legal issues and family reliance on information from the Internet. As examples of these barriers, we describe and discuss two cases that occurred simultaneously in the same NICU where decisions were influenced by social and cultural differences that were misunderstood by both medical staff and patients' families. The resulting stress and emotional discomfort created an environment with sub-optimal relationships between patients' families and health care providers. We provide background on the sources of conflict in these particular cases. We also offer suggestions for possible amelioration of similar conflicts with the twin goals of facilitating compassionate decision making in NICU settings and promoting enhanced well-being of both families and providers.},

abstract = {Creativity has become a modern concept. In several job advertisement, organisation state that they are looking for an employee of 'creative' nature. There is however several perspectives on what creativity is and is achieved. The purpose for this thesis was to explore the perception of creativity in Human computer interaction (HCI), and how HCI-professionals working in organisations relate to and with creativity in their work. Research on how creativity can be facilitated is currently divided, some researchers advocate complete freedom while others favour control by methods. In this study, we chose to interview six persons in different organisations that are working with HCI. We found that creativity in HCI is a continuous interplay between freedom and structure, or sometimes referred to as restrictions. In order to be creative, the professionals have to find the preferred balance for the specific project. Creativity can either result in small incremental improvements or entirely new ideas. It is ideal to not focus entirely on only new things. Instead the HCI-professionals need to have the analytical skill and understanding to now when there is an opportunity for it. Creativity generating methods are not supposed to be followed strictly. They are rather chosen and adapted to each project. Changing the creativity methods between projects contributes to new ways of thinking and prevents the risk of ending up with similar type of results.},

In this paper, we present a design model for empowering low-income women in the developing world, in ways that cut across individual application areas. Specifically, this model characterizes a possible trajectory for NGOs and women to engage with each other and among themselves potentially augmented by technology to help women escape from poverty. The fieldwork components in this study took place over 15 weeks in three phases, with a total of 47 NGO staff members and 35 socio-economically challenged women in rural and urban India. Interviews and co-design sessions with seven proof-of-concept prototypes showed that women appeared to belong to five distinct stages of growth in striving towards independence. We report the technology design lessons from our co-design sessions to illustrate how user readiness, relationship building at the community and family levels, and integration with state, national and international level programs, should be taken into account in the broader context of intervention design.},

abstract = {Living Archives is a research project exploring the roles of archives in a digitised society. Together, with the Malm{\"{o}} City Archives, we initiated a project aiming at prototyping co-archiving practices for young newcomers, to contribute to a newcomers archive. The project emerged as a reaction to the situation in 2015, where 162,877 people sought asylum in Sweden. In response to this situation the Malm{\"{o}} City Archives is organising activities to wel- come and help integrate newcomers. This paper however, doesn't focus on the design proposals prototyped as part of the project, but on ethical challenges when collaborating with vulnerable user groups. Before starting the research process we attended a seminar to discuss our ethical stand. We also revisited the ethical standards in research, as well as papers on ethical considerations in design research. Nevertheless, in encountering the youngsters we realised that we were not adequately prepared. To think about ethical standpoints in theory is one thing, but what happens in situ is something else. In this paper we highlight our personal expe- riences in our first meetings with the user group. We discuss the complexities of establishing collaborations with vulnerable groups, to avoid a na{\"{i}}ve view of what such projects, and collaborations require in terms of time and resources. Given the current refugee situation and the potentials of design actions to tackle major societal problems, it is likely that many design researchers will be engaging with these issues, thus these discussions are required.},

abstract = {Recent HCI research has highlighted the potential afforded by maker technologies for supporting new forms of DIY Assistive Technology (DIY-AT) for people with disabilities. Furthermore, the popular discourse surrounding both the maker movement and disability is one of democratisation and empowerment. Despite this, critics argue that maker movement membership lacks diversity and that within DIY-AT, it is seldom the people with disabilities who are creating such designs. We conducted a qualitative study that explored how people with disabilities experience the empowering potential of making. We analysed online videos by makers with disabilities and conducted fieldwork at two makerspaces. These informed the design of DIY-Abilities, a series of workshops for people with disabilities in which participants could learn different maker technologies and complete their own maker project. Through analysis of participants' narratives we contribute a new perspective on the specific social and material capacities of accessible maker initiatives.},

@article{Analysis1991,
abstract = {Cooperative Prototyping can be characterized as the use and development of prototypes as catalysts during discussions between designers and potential users-the overall intention being one of mutual learning. On the one hand, the designers learn more about the work practices of the users in ways that are tied concretely to some current version of the prototype. On the other hand, the users learn more about the potential for change in their work practice, whether computer-based or otherwise. This paper presents the results of a field study of the cooperative prototyping process. The study is based on a fine-grained video-based analysis of a single prototyping session, and focuses on the effects of an open-ended style of interaction between users and designers around a prototype. An analysis of focus shifts, initiative and storytelling during the session is brought to bear on the question of whether and how cooperative prototyping can be successful with users who are reluctant to 'play in the future.' The paper also discusses issues in applying video analysis to system design.},

abstract = {That informed consent is a process rather than a once-off encounter is important to grasp. This insight may be well understood in the social science context, depending on the research methodology of the particular study. For example, where the methodology involves ethnography, participant observation, several interviews over an extended period of time etc, both the researcher and the participant will grasp that the informed consent process is on-going. The precise nature of the process depends on the type of methodology. In some instances, however, notably when only a brief encounter between researcher and participant is anticipated, the informed consent process seems to be regarded as a necessary obstacle to be overcome rather than recognising the importance of the process. The tone of informed consent documentation should be respectful and mindful of the fact that any research participant can decline to participate. Consequently, the invitation to participate should indicate to potential participants that their participation would be appreciated. Many information sheets and consent forms that come before the HSRC Research Ethics Committee are worded appropriately but disconcertingly there are many that are not so worded, necessitating interventions by the REC.},

Despite this effort, little research has explored how fathers go online related to their roles as fathers. Drawing on an interview study with 37 fathers, we find that they use social media to document and archive fatherhood, learn how to be a father, and access social support. They also go online to support diverse family needs, such as single fathers' use of Reddit instead of Facebook, fathers raised by single mothers' search for role models online, and stay-at-home fathers' use of father blogs. However, fathers are constrained by privacy concerns and perceptions of judgment relating to sharing content online about their children. Drawing on theories of fatherhood, we present theoretical and design ideas for designing online spaces to better support fathers and fatherhood. We conclude with a call for a research agenda to support fathers online.},

abstract = {Newborns are perhaps the most vulnerable population the world over. Preterm or babies born too early, less than 37 weeks gestation, are particularly at risk. Currently, prematurity is the leading cause of death among children under five around the world, and a leading cause of disability and ill health later in life. Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia account for over 60 percent of preterm births worldwide. Of the fifteen million babies born too early each year, more than one million die due to complications related to preterm birth. Low birth weight (newborns weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth), due to prematurity and/or restricted growth in utero, is also a major contributor of newborn and child deaths, as well as disability and non-communicable diseases globally. Nearly 85 percent of preterm babies are born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation and most of these babies do not need intensive care to survive. Solutions to improve the survival and health of vulnerable preterm and low birth weight babies exist. Essential newborn care (drying, warming, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, hygiene and cord care) as well as basic care for feeding support, infections and breathing difficulties can mean the difference between life and death for small babies. More effort is needed to identify women at risk of preterm labor and support them to give birth in a health facility that can offer extra care when needed, such as support for adequate feeding with breast milk, continuous skin to skin contact, antibiotics, and antenatal corticosteroids. To do this, it is critical that families, communities and health care workers value small babies so that they receive the life-saving care they need. To turn the tide on these preventable deaths, we need action across the spectrum of care from adolescence and preconception, pregnancy, the safe management of labor and delivery, and effective immediate and later postnatal care. Current, local data are crucial to inform priorities and drive scale-up. This national level profile provides the most current national-level information on the status of prevention and care for preterm birth and low birth weight in Kenya. Data presented highlight a number of risk factors relevant to preterm and low birth weight in Kenya as well as the coverage of important care for women and newborns from pregnancy, labor and delivery and the postnatal period. There is also information that provides insights into the health workforce, health policies, health information and community mobilization relevant to preterm birth and low birth weight.},

The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a particularly challenging environment for new mothers as several natural processes are disrupted. The objective of this study is to elucidate protective factors and environmental deficits associated with the NICU. The experiences of forty-six (n = 46) mothers of infants admitted to a Level III NICU in the Midwestern United States, who responded to a related open-ended question, were analyzed thematically. Five themes related to the NICU environment emerged as being either stressful or helpful: (1) amount and quality of communication with medical staff, (2) bedside manner of medical staff, (3) feeling alienated from infant's care, (4) support from other NICU mothers and families, and (5) NICU Physical Environment and Regulations. There is a need for medical staff training on awareness, communication, empathy, and other behaviors that might improve maternal (and parental) experiences in the NICU. The physical environment, including rules and regulations of the NICU, should be reexamined with family comfort in mind in addition to the clinical care of the infant.},

abstract = {Objective: This study examined mothers' and fathers' perceptions of effective and ineffective communication by nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment, using communication accommodation theory (CAT) as the framework. Methods: Twenty mothers and 13 fathers participated in a semi-structured interview about their perceptions of effective and ineffective communication with nurses when their infant was in the NICU. The interviews were coded for using the CAT strategies. Results: Descriptions of effective and ineffective communication differed in terms of the strategies mentioned with effective communication about shared management of the interaction and appropriate support and reassurance by nurses. Ineffective communication was more about the interpretability strategy, particularly for fathers, and these interactions were seen as more intergroup. Mothers emphasised more being encouraged as equal partners in the care of their infant. Conclusion: Effective communication by nurses was accommodative and more interpersonal while ineffective communication was generally under-accommodative and more intergroup. Practice implications: The findings provide a framework for communication skills training for nurses that identifies both effective and ineffective communication strategies to use with mothers and fathers. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Tshwane District in Gauteng Province, SA, has been experiencing an increasing strain on obstetric and neonatal services at central, tertiary and regional hospitals in recent years as a result of growing population numbers and rapid up-referral of patients, with limited down-referral of low-risk patients to district-level services. We describe a successful multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative under the leadership of the Tshwane DCST, in conjunction with experienced local KMC implementers, aimed at expanding the district's KMC services.

Our goal is to sketch a map of how these ingredients hang together and to illustrate that with examples from cases and underlying principles. ins01.gif Our perspective is informed by academic writing, but more so by our experiences with design practice in both industry and academia. Neither of us is a designer in the traditional sense; rather, we are practitioners and educators of co-designing. The observations here stem from many years of developing design research in the "fuzzy front end," connecting design research to conceptualization and development, and educating future co-designers.},

abstract = {For the first time, the WHO's Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) has sought to determine the status of mobile health (mHealth) in Member States; its second global survey in 2009 contained a section specifically devoted to mHealth. Completed by 114 Member States, the survey documented for analysis 4 aspects of mHealth: adoption of initiatives, types of initiatives, status of evaluation, and barriers to implementation. Fourteen categories of mHealth services were surveyed: health call centres, emergency toll-free telephone services, managing emergencies and disasters, mobile telemedicine, appointment reminders, community mobilization and health promotion, treatment compliance, mobile patient records, information access, patient monitoring, health surveys and data collection, surveillance, health awareness raising, and decision support systems. This report aims to make policy-makers aware of the mHealth landscape and the main barriers to implement or scale mHealth projects. It combines the results and analysis of the data gathered from the mHealth survey, and is complemented by 5 country case-studies and a review of the current literature related to mHealth.},

abstract = {The discourse in healthcare Knowledge Mobilisation (KMb) literature has shifted from simple, linear models of research knowledge production and action to more iterative and complex models. These aim to blend multiple stakeholders' knowledge with research knowledge to address the research-practice gap. It has been suggested there is no ‘magic bullet', but that a promising approach to take is knowledge co-creation in healthcare, particularly if a number of principles are applied. These include systems thinking, positioning research as a creative enterprise with human experience at its core, and paying attention to process within the partnership. This discussion paper builds on this proposition and extends it beyond knowledge co-creation to co-designing evidenced based interventions and implementing them. Within a co-design model, we offer a specific approach to share, mobilise and activate knowledge, that we have termed ‘collective making'. We draw on KMb, design, wider literature, and our experiences to describe how this framework supports and extends the principles of co-creation offered by Geenhalgh et al. [1] in the context of the state of the art of knowledge mobilisation. We describe how collective making creates the right ‘conditions' for knowledge to be mobilised particularly addressing issues relating to stakeholder relationships, helps to discover, share and blend different forms of knowledge from different stakeholders, and puts this blended knowledge to practical use allowing stakeholders to learn about the practical implications of knowledge use and to collectively create actionable products. We suggest this collective making has three domains of influence: on the participants; on the knowledge discovered and shared; and on the mobilisation or activation of this knowledge.},

abstract = {Acculturation plays an important role in cultural product design with embedded information technologies. Therefore designing culture into products will become a design approach in interaction design. Interaction design has switched focus from usability and cognitive ergonomics to the affective aspects of user interactive experience. For cultural product design, we need a better understanding of acculturation in human-culture interaction not just for taking part in the cultural context, but also for developing the interactive experience of users. The framework for human-culture interaction in design process proposed and discussed in this paper is of value for acculturation in cultural product design. The framework also can help designers to consider how to design "culture features" into cultural products as well as provide users with a valuable reference for understanding interactive experience in products. While cultural features become an important issue in the interactive user experience, we need a better understanding of the acculturation process not only for the designer's model, but also for that of the user. For future studies, the acculturation process between human and culture in the cultural product design is worthy of further in-depth study.},

abstract = {Background: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Methods: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO's country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries. Findings: In 2010, an estimated 14{\textperiodcentered}9 million babies (uncertainty range 12{\textperiodcentered}3-18{\textperiodcentered}1 million) were born preterm, 11{\textperiodcentered}1 of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5 in several European countries to 18 in some African countries. More than 60 of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52 of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010. Interpretation: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

Design of an appropriate solution requires meeting the various and conflicting requirements of all of these stakeholders. In this paper we detail the rapid design and testing of a pilot implementation of a mobile and web-based system for processing claims forms, based on two prior field visits to Uganda. Based on a comparative device study, semi-structured interviews, health clinic surveys, and a brief deployment, we affirm the selection of the mobile phone as a platform from the health clinic perspective, and further suggest that effective design for development requires more than addressing requirements of the the ¿users¿ of the mobile phones but also all the other stakeholders involved, who may have conflicting requirements.},

abstract = {Computing systems that place a high level of burden on their users can have a negative effect on initial adoption, retention, and overall user experience. Through an iterative process, we have developed a model for user burden that consists of six constructs: 1) difficulty of use, 2) physical, 3) time and social, 4) mental and emotional, 5) privacy, and 6) financial. If researchers and practitioners can have an understanding of the overall level of burden systems may be having on the user, they can have a better sense of whether and where to target future design efforts that can reduce those burdens. To help assist with understanding and measuring user burden, we have also developed and validated a measure of user burden in computing systems called the User Burden Scale (UBS), which is a 20-item scale with 6 individual sub-scales representing each construct. This paper presents the process we followed to develop and validate this scale for use in evaluating user burden in computing systems. Results indicate that the User Burden Scale has good overall inter-item reliability, convergent validity with similar scales, and concurrent validity when compared to systems abandoned vs. those still in use.},

abstract = {The emergence of ‘third paradigm' Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) was driven by the shortcomings of existing approaches to adequately describe and understand the ways people interact with a new breed of pervasive digital technologies in everyday life. In response, new approaches became situated, value-driven and participatory with a shift towards studying HCI in the wild. With technology reaching into every aspect of our lives, the ethical and moral responsibilities of designers and researchers have increased. However, while HCI's design and research methodology have become fluid and responsive to reflect the paradigm shift, ethics is still widely interpreted as a static, anticipatory and formalised process. In this article, we address this gap and propose In-Action Ethics as a novel framework that links anticipatory ethics with the practice of HCI research. We start by laying out the foundations for In-Action Ethics by reviewing relevant work in ethics and moral philosophy, and discuss the current state of ethical perspectives in HCI, Action Research and Responsible Science and Innovation. We provide two examples from our own work to show how situated, explorative and design-oriented HCI projects raise issues of ethical importance that formal ethics is struggling to manage. On the basis of our experiences and those of others, we start developing key qualities for an In-Action Ethics framework and show how those qualities can be operationalised in relation to the realities of existing structures by introducing the concept of ethos building and care.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: Many clinical sites that serve patients who are HIV positive face challenges of insufficient staffing levels and staff training and have limited access to consultation resources including specialists on site. Uliza! (Swahili for "ask") Clinicians' HIV Hotline was launched in April 2006 in Nyanza province in Kenya as a HIV telephone consultation service for healthcare providers. Hotline users called an Uliza! consultant who discussed the patients' problems and helped the caller work through a solution, as well as reinforced national guidelines. This objective of this study was to evaluate the uptake, acceptability, and effectiveness of Uliza! Materials and Methods: Consultants completed a form with details of each call, and healthcare workers completed satisfaction surveys during site visits. All available medical records were audited to determine whether the advice given by the consultant was implemented. Results: After a year of service, Uliza! responded to 296 calls. Clinical officers (64{\%}) followed by nurses (21{\%}) most frequently used the service. Most callers had questions regarding antiretroviral therapy (36{\%}) or tuberculosis (18{\%}). Thirty-six percent of all consults were pediatric questions. Ninety-four percent of users rated the service as useful. Advice given to providers was implemented and documented in the medical records in 72{\%} of the charts audited. Conclusion: Healthcare providers in HIV clinics will use a telephone consultation service when easily accessible. Clinicians using Uliza! found it useful, and advice given was usually implemented. Uliza! increased access to current information for quality care in a rural and resource limited setting and has potential for scale-up to a national level.},

abstract = {Paediatric wards in South African government hospitals are occupied predominantly by children with HIV and AIDS-related illnesses. Although access to anti-retroviral treatment for adults is being scaled up, it is likely to be many years before South Africa achieves anywhere near universal access for children. Currently, most children living with HIV or AIDS are identified only when they become acutely or chronically ill and/or hospitalized , if at all. In the absence of treatment, the stress of caring for ill and hospitalized HIV-positive children often results in emotional withdrawal among both health professionals and caregivers. The demoralizing cycle of repeated admissions, treatment failure and death also affect the quality of the care given to HIV-negative children in over-burdened wards. This article describes the development of simple, low-cost and context-relevant interventions to improve the care environment for young hospitalized children within the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and poverty.},

We initiated a co-design process using participatory action research to empower CHWs to use their own knowledge and experiences to define our shared design and research agenda. We present our process and its outcomes, noting the importance of engaging with CHWs using techniques considerate of their literacy and experience, and the necessity of separating the concept from the artefact in the process of co-design. Further, we demonstrate how deep engagement and multiple participatory action research cycles give CHWs time to develop confidence and experience around the use of technology in their work. We argue that when CHWs are empowered to contribute their creativity and local experiences in this manner, the outcome is technology that is best suited for their unique context of work, in ways that would not be achieved using conventional approaches to co-design. Finally, we present early outcomes of the co-design efforts, articulating design requirements for a feedback mechanism for CHWs.},

abstract = {HIV/AIDS is changing the human landscape in sub-Saharan Africa. Relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. Given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with Lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14. Twenty-four HIV/AIDS adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, CD4 counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 mL supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. Hematologic profiles, CD4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. There was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. The probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days had a mean WBC count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/L, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/L, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/L, respectively. However, the mean CD4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared to 3/12 in the control. Diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. This is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in Nigeria with HIV/AIDS, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.},

abstract = {Neonatal Survival 1 4 million neonatal deaths: When? Where? Why? Joy E Lawn, Simon Cousens, Jelka Zupan, for the Lancet Neonatal Survival Steering Team* The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38{\%} in 2000) is increasing, and the Millennium Development Goal for child survival cannot be met without substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0{\textperiodcentered}5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week—the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99{\%}) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1{\%} of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10–15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28{\%}), severe infections (26{\%}), and asphyxia (23{\%}). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7{\%}), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century. Of},

@article{Moyer2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infants born prematurely or with complex medical problems are surviving to discharge in growing numbers and often require significant monitoring and coordination of care in the ambulatory setting. Using Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (HFMEA), we identified a large number of potentially serious error points in this transition of care. PURPOSE To test whether a multifaceted intervention that included a health coach to assist families and an enhanced personal health record to improve the quality of information available to parents and community professionals would decrease adverse events and improve family assessment of the transition. METHODS: Using a concurrent cohort design, infants in one geographic area (pod) of the intensive care nursery received the intervention; infants in two other pods received routine discharge care. Primary outcomes included deaths, sick visits, unplanned readmissions and missed appointments within 1 month of discharge. The family assessed the transition using a modified version of the Care Transitions Measure. RESULTS: 125 intervention infants (54{\%} boys) and 104 control infants (48{\%} boys) were enrolled over 18 months. The groups were similar in maternal education, insurance status, language spoken and number of adults in the home, birth weight and length of stay. At least one adverse outcome occurred in 63 (50.4{\%}) intervention infants and 56 (53.8{\%}) control infants (p=0.55). At 24-48 h post discharge, caregivers in the intervention group had significantly higher scores on the adapted care transitions measure (3.51 vs 3.27, p{\textless}0.0001); however, at 30 days, the difference was no longer significant (3.45 vs 3.40, p=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent discharge intervention designed to address specific problems identified using HFMEA did not reduce certain adverse outcomes in the post-discharge period.

abstract = {This note uncovers a design tension in participatory design practice in the context of two organizations in Nepal working on reducing sex-trafficking and helping survivors. The dilemma consists of con- tradictions between the public face that the organizations present to the world and the more complex underlying picture painted by sur- vivors. In initial work, we created and deployed a value-elicitation game for survivors that gave us better access to their voices. How- ever, the implications for ongoing participatory work remain to be unpacked. The veneer may constitute a necessary part of the staffs' successful interactions with external funders. The survivors rely on the resources that the organization gathers, yet the veneer may also obscure some aspects of the survivors' needs. The question raised is “how should our PD practice position itself with respect to the ideal of comprehensive democratic participation when potential harm may ensue to vulnerable people?”},

In the mobile health education project discussed in this thesis (The Bophelo Haeso project), we1 sought to find ways to amplify CHWs' voices, enabling them to directly influence design and research processes as well as technological outcomes. The Bophelo Haeso (BH) project equips CHWs with health videos on their mobile phones to use for educating and counselling the rural public. We investigated how to best co-design, with CHWs, a feedback mechanism atop the basic BH health education model, thus enabling their voices in the design process and in the process of community education. This thesis chronicles this inclusive design and research process—a 30-month process that spanned three sub-studies: an 18-month process to co-design the feedback mechanism with CHWs, a 12-month deployment study of the feedback mechanism and, overlapping with the feedback deployment study, a 17-month study looking at the consumption patterns of the BH educational videos. This work contributes to the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in three distinct ways.},

abstract = {Women are actively encouraged to educate themselves about pregnancy from formal sources (e.g., information leaflets, antenatal classes, books). In addition, informal stories of pregnancy and birth are routinely told between women. However, increased prenatal testing means that more fetuses are diagnosed with abnormalities, shifting the information requirements during pregnancy. Traditional sources of information cannot cover all possible outcomes, and the Internet is beginning to fill this gap. In this article, we draw from interviews about experiences of antenatal screening and pregnancy to explore how the Internet provides a unique resource for problematic pregnancies. It allows access to information about rarer conditions beyond standard pregnancy texts, as well as personal narratives about conditions. Learning how others have coped or are coping in similar situations can help alleviate feelings of isolation, and also places women back in a familiar territory of shared pregnancy narratives.},

The model supports multiple forms and degrees of awareness of the remote difficulty, and allows multiple kinds and degrees of sharing. It is scalable in that it allows a single helper to resolve the difficulties of a large number of people in difficulty. It has been implemented for a programming class and motivated by experience using a previous system in such a class.

abstract = {This exploratory paper is part of a series that examines the role of mobile technology in the lives of adolescents and young people living in developing nations. The current report focuses on South Africa and is based on primary data collected in the previous series of this publication and secondary evidence gathered through a desk review of relevant literature. This report presents, first, in section two, an overview context of South Africa, and her digital landscape; Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development in South Africa has flourished in the past years, particularly with regard to mobile access and use, though continues to lag in computer and stationary Internet ownership and use. Section three investigates the use of mobile technology by South African adolescents and young people. Extensive research identified a number of characteristics unique to the South African digital landscape: most notably, there exists in South Africa a series of persistent digital divides based on socio-economics, geography and language, as well as in ICT ownership, access, and use. Section four investigates popular communication activities used and accessed among South African adolescents and young people. That said, the nation, as a whole, leads in the content as creation and consumption on social networking platforms, namely Mxit and Twitter. With high access and use comes also a need for awareness of global opportunities and risk. Section five of this report discusses also the types of safety risks adolescents and young people are exposed to while using mobiles, including: cyberbullying, sexting, privacy and exposure to sexually explicit images. The final section of the current paper discusses public and private initiatives to increase opportunities for South African citizens to optimally and safely access and use ICTs.},

The goal of our workshop is to brainstorm and discuss how we might demarginalize those researched, this research, and these researchers within CSCW scholarship. For this, we build on the concepts of intersectionality and solidarity from feminist scholarship, aiming to recognize the differences and similarities across disparate contexts, and to uncover synergistic research trajectories and objectives. Our workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers pursuing CSCW, Social Computing, and Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) research focused on intersectionality, equity, and inclusion. We invite a broad range of participants from research and practice interested in learning about or deepening their understanding of these topics. Our workshop will foster solidarity across diverse subsections of the CSCW community and beyond.},

A qualitative study was conducted to identify the reasons, sources, and types of HIV-related stigma prevalent in rural China. Eighty in-depth interviews were conducted with people living with HIV/AIDS, their family members, health care providers, and uninfected villagers. Stigmatizing behaviors were primarily associated with fear of HIV rather than with the route of infection. Uninfected villagers were the main source of discrimination, with health workers and family members also holding some stigmatizing attitudes. A primary concern for HIV-positive villagers was protecting their families, especially their children, from discrimination. Secondary stigma also extended to un- infected members of the same village. The results have been used to develop an intervention to reduce fear of casual transmission and stigma in these communities.},

abstract = {Conflicts are likely to arise among participants in a collaborative design process as the inevitable outgrowth of the differing perspectives and viewpoints involved. The opportunities for conflict are magnified if many perspectives are brought to bear on a common artifact early in the design process, as in concurrent engineering or integrated engineering. Design advice tools can assist in the process of resolving these conflicts by making critiques and suggestions conveniently available to design participants, and by offering a fair means of evaluating and comparing suggested alternatives for compromise solution. In previous work we introduced a protocol based on notions of economic utility by which design advice systems can recognize conflict and mediate negotiation fairly. This protocol allowed design teams to express the desire to maximize or minimize the values of design parameters over totally ordered bounded domains of values, such as real numeric intervals. In this paper we extend this approach by allowing expressed preferences of design teams to be qualitative as well as quantitative, by allowing teams to express interest in parameters before they actually come into existence, and by relaxing many other of the earlier restrictions on the ways teams may express their preferences},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observation is used in research in two ways - structured and unstructured. Which of these methods to choose depends on the research question but will be defined predominantly by the paradigm underlying each study. Positivistic research generally uses structured observation and interpretist/naturalistic paradigms use unstructured observation. This paper is concerned with unstructured observation. AIM: To discuss the importance of unstructured observation as a research method and to examine critically the problems associated with both access and field notes. APPLICATION TO NURSING: Although unstructured observation has been used in nursing research, it is less favoured than the interview. Furthermore, although some of the dilemmas concerned with observation such as the role of the researcher, covert research and informed consent have received attention in the nursing literature, other aspects remain relatively unexplored. In particular little has been written concerning access to the field and field notes. Both of these aspects have practical and theoretical considerations that require the attention of the researcher. This omission may partly explain nurses' apparent reluctance to use unstructured observation in their studies. This paper seeks to redress this situation.},

abstract = {Background: The admission of a very premature infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is often a difficult time for parents. This paper explores parents' views and experiences of the care for their very premature baby on NICU.Methods: Parents were eligible if they had a baby born before 32 weeks gestation and cared for in a NICU, and spoke English well. 32 mothers and 7 fathers were interviewed to explore their experiences of preterm birth. Although parents' evaluation of care in the NICU was not the aim of these interviews, all parents spoke spontaneously and at length on this topic. Results were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Overall, parents were satisfied with the care on the neonatal unit. Three major themes determining satisfaction with neonatal care emerged: 1) parents' involvement; including looking after their own baby, the challenges of expressing breast milk, and easy access to their baby; 2) staff competence and efficiency; including communication, experience and confidence, information and explanation; and 3) interpersonal relationships with staff; including sensitive and emotional support, reassurance and encouragement, feeling like an individual.Conclusions: Determinants of positive experiences of care were generally consistent with previous research. Specifically, provision of information, support for parents and increasing their involvement in the care of their baby were highlighted by parents as important in their experience of care.},

This paper is a result of a student project, guided by a curiosity about how empowerment is enunciated in the PD field today. In a literature-review of academic papers from the proceedings of PDC 2008 we found that empowerment is enunciated in five different ways which can be translated into 5 categories: 1) Specific user groups 2) Direct democracy 3) The users' position 4) Researchers' practice 5) Reflexive practice. These categories exist conjointly in the literature and suggest that empowerment is not just a moral and politically correct design goal, but a challenged and complex activity.},

It does so within the context of new ethical bureaucracies (Boden et al., in press; Hammersley, 2006). Drawing upon an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded methodological research project exploring the everyday lives and identities of eight children and young people in care, the article reinvigorates the intersubjective, situated and negotiated approach to research ethics as ongoing dialogue in everyday fieldwork relations. We consider the concept of 'becoming participant' to foreground the micro-ethical moments of complex and ambivalent engagements and disengagements within the research process. The notion of 'becoming participant', we suggest, may provide a concep-tual language of description to analyse the complex terrain of consent, as always-in-process and unfinished. Drawing upon episodes of recorded fieldwork relations, we apply this notion to explore what it means to undertake participatory},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved. A new tool for modification of the materials by swift heavy ions is investigated. The role of ion velocity is explored on various properties of 1 at.{\%} Ag doped CdS nanocrystalline thin films. Ag doping in CdS is carried out by chemical co-precipitation method. Thin films of 1{\%} Ag doped CdS are grown by pulsed laser deposition at a substrate temperature of 200 °C in vacuum using a target prepared by pressing and sintering the chemically synthesized powder. The Ag doping in CdS is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies carried out for 5{\%} Ag doped CdS sample. Thin films of 1{\%} Ag doped CdS are further irradiated using 70 MeV and 160 MeV Ni+6 ions at varying fluence. The velocity of 160 MeV Ni ions is √ 2 times than that of 70 MeV Ni ions while electronic energy loss remains almost same at the two energies. GAXRD results reveals that the film irradiated with the higher ion velocity at fluence 1×1014 ions/cm2 is highly textured. It is observed that diffraction peaks are shifted toward higher angle with increase in ion fluence for either of the ion energy, however in case of 160 MeV Ni+6 ion irradiation shifting is comparatively less. Raman spectra show four optical phonon modes viz. fundamental (1LO), multiphonon scattering (1LO+2E2), first over tone (2LO) and multiphonon scattering (2LO+2E2) modes at 302, 400, 603 and 702 cm-1, respectively. The intensity and asymmetry variation exhibits by Raman active mode is not same for the films irradiated by the ions of different ion velocities. UV-Visible absorption spectra show a systematic reduction in band gap i.e., increment in particle size with increase in ions fluence at both energies. The photoluminescence studies further suggest that ion beam irradiation is a powerful tool to enhance the quantum efficiency.},

A number of potential stressors to which family members of patients in these units may be exposed have been identified, although no studies about this issue have been conducted in Rwanda.Aim: The aim of this study was to describe and analyse parental perception of stress that resulted from having their infant admitted to a NICU in Kigali, Rwanda.Method: A quantitative survey was used to describe and analyse parents' perceptions of stress when they had an infant admitted to a NICU. The Parental Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was used to measure the level of stress that those parents experienced.Results: The results indicated that parents experienced stress from having their infants cared for in a NICU. The most stressful events were the appearance and behaviour of the baby with a mean score of 4.02, whilst the subscale items related to sights and sounds were found to be the least significant source of stress for parents with a mean score of 2.51. In addition, the current study found that parents' age, educational level, occupation, and infant birth weight were associated with parental stress.Conclusion: The study established that a range of factors was responsible for parental stress when a baby was cared for in a NICU. Identification of these factors could enable health professionals from a hospital in Kigali, Rwanda, to facilitate parents' adjusting and coping.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have explored the effect of a gender-specific infertility diagnosis on the responses of couples in Taiwan. The purpose of this research was to compare the differences in distress, marital and sexual satisfaction in husbands and wives based on an infertility diagnosis. METHODS: Three structured questionnaires were used. RESULTS: Female members of couples in which both partners were infertile expressed less marital and sexual satisfaction than their husbands. No differences in marital and sexual satisfaction were found between wives and husbands with unexplained infertility. Only wives with a diagnosed female infertility expressed higher distress to infertility than their husbands. Although no differences in psychosocial responses were found among husbands, regardless of the diagnosis, wives with a diagnosed female infertility experienced higher distress in self-esteem and less satisfaction in acceptance by in-laws than wives experiencing a diagnosed male infertility. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the diagnosis of infertility is an important factor in assessing the differences in infertility distress and marital and sexual satisfaction between husbands and wives. Health professionals can explain the gender differences when counselling infertile couples and encourage them to share each other's feelings, which may help couples to cope with the communication problems they may experience.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. With the proliferation of mobile devices, provision of M-health care services has become feasible even in the remotest villages of Africa. Research however shows that many M-health initiatives have not been adopted and used effectively especially in rural communities. Some of the factors contributing to this range from a lack of knowledge with regard the use of technology, literacy challenges, possible fear of technology, to a lack of information regarding these interventions. In this paper, we demonstrate that an initiative designed to recognize usability as its core function plays a critical role in the use and adoption of M-health interventions in rural communities. Two versions of an M-health intervention were developed and two interface design principles that may have an impact on users' emotions applied, namely affective design and anthropomorphism. Using the Sethakeng rural community in the Northern Cape (South Africa) as the case study, we were able to determine the extent to which both anthropomorphism and affective design influence the adoption of an M-Health application. Further, the research revealed that because of its ability to include human-like qualities to non-living objects, anthropomorphism is a more effective method for designing M-Health applications targeting rural communities.},

The development of a working medical screening and diagnosis expert system for use at the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics in Madison County, IL is described. The system was designed and implemented over a period of four months. A large number of knowledge acquisition techniques were used, some of them customized in ways that greatly increased their effectiveness. This work explores the development of the WIC Advisor, from problem definition through expert system delivery. Important factors in the success of this expert system were the selection of a limited diagnostic domain, and the choice of multiple experts. The major benefits of the system include assisting clients between clinic visits, cataloging basic medical data, and providing consistent and verifiable information},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although low birth weight premature infants and parents are at high risk for adverse health outcomes, there is a paucity of studies that test early NICU interventions with parents to prevent the development of negative parent-infant interaction trajectories and to reduce hospital length of stay. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of an educational-behavioral intervention program (ie, Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment) that was designed to enhance parent-infant interactions and parent mental health outcomes for the ultimate purpose of improving child developmental and behavior outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with 260 families with preterm infants from 2001 to 2004 in 2 NICUs in the northeast United States. Parents completed self-administered instruments during hospitalization, within 7 days after infant discharge, and at 2 months' corrected age. Blinded observers rated parent-infant interactions in the NICU. INTERVENTION: All participants received 4 intervention sessions of audiotaped and written materials. Parents in the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment program received information and behavioral activities about the appearance and behavioral characteristics of preterm infants and how best to parent them. The comparison intervention contained information regarding hospital services and policies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental stress, depression, anxiety, and beliefs; parent-infant interaction during the NICU stay; NICU length of stay; and total hospitalization were measured. RESULTS: Mothers in the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment program reported significantly less stress in the NICU and less depression and anxiety at 2 months' corrected infant age than did comparison mothers. Blinded observers rated mothers and fathers in the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment program as more positive in interactions with their infants. Mothers and fathers also reported stronger beliefs about their parental role and what behaviors and characteristics to expect of their infants during hospitalization. Infants in the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment program had a 3.8-day shorter NICU length of stay (mean: 31.86 vs 35.63 days) and 3.9-day shorter total hospital length of stay (mean: 35.29 vs 39.19 days) than did comparison infants. CONCLUSIONS: A reproducible educational-behavioral intervention program for parents that commences early in the NICU can improve parent mental health outcomes, enhance parent-infant interaction, and reduce hospital length of stay.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the manner in which technology teachers actualise critical thinking skills while supporting learners to solve technological problems. Technology as a subject was introduced in South African schools by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) with the intention to, inter alia, develop learners' critical thinking skills while using the prescribed design process. The Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) for technology stipulates that technology should provide learners with the opportunity to solve authentic problems that are embedded in real-life experiences. Solving these authentic technological problems requires learners to engage with critical thinking skills. This entails learners interpreting, analysing, evaluating information, drawing inferences, providing an explanation, and conducting self-regulations. While the importance of critical thinking is widely acknowledged, it seems that teachers find it difficult to actualise these critical thinking skills in the classroom. In addition to this, the literature suggests that technology teachers limit their teaching to the lower cognitive levels, failing to develop learners' higher-order thinking abilities. This is problematic and a reason for concern. This study thus sought to investigate this problem. The conceptual framework used in the study was based on the design process as prescribed by the DBE (2011) and Facione's (1990) critical thinking skills framework. The design process involves the following skills, to: Investigate, Design, Make, Evaluate, and Communicate (IDMEC). Facione's critical thinking skills encompass: Interpretation, Analysis, Evaluation, Inference, Explanation, and Self-Regulation. These critical thinking skills were linked to the DBE design process to demonstrate the way in which critical thinking skills could be actualised within the different steps of the design process. This study engaged in qualitative research using a multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to select the participants. Technology teachers who obtained a Bachelor of Education in technology education with at least four years of experience teaching technology were considered as suitable participants. Data was collected by means of structured interviews and observations. Data was analysed using the conceptual framework.},

abstract = {When encountering qualitative research for the first time, one is confronted with both the number of methods and the difficulty of collecting, analysing and presenting large amounts of data. In quantitative research, it is possible to make a clear distinction between gathering and analysing data. However, this distinction is not clear-cut in qualitative research. The objective of this paper is to provide insight for the novice researcher and the experienced researcher coming to grounded theory for the first time. For those who already have experience in the use of the method the paper provides further much needed discussion arising out of デｴW ﾏWデｴﾗSげゲ ;Sﾗヮデｷﾗﾐ ｷﾐ デｴW I“ aｷWﾉSく In this paper the authors present a practical application and illustrate how grounded theory method was applied to an interpretive case study research. The paper discusses grounded theory method and provides guidance for the use of the method in interpretive studies. Keywords: grounded theory; interpretive; case study; data collection; data analysis; qualitative; quantitative 1. Introduction One of the main problems of conducting interpretive qualitative research is to decide an appropriate starting point for the research, and the basic framework within which the data will be collected and analysed. Qualitative studies tend to produce large amounts of data that are not readily amenable to mechanical manipulation, analysis and data reduction (Yin, 1984). It not only generates large amount of data, but it generates data in a non standard format which makes analysis problematic (Turner, 1983). Qualitative analysis provides an opportunity for the researcher to gain information and gather insights that may be overlooked with traditional data analysis techniques. The analysis of the case study is done in pursuant to guidance provided by many scholars in this field, (such as Glaser, 1978; Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Lofland and Lofland, 1984; and Taylor and Bogdan, 1984).},

Interviews and participant observation in two villages showed a profusion of ICT devices, as well as an abundance of face-to-face information exchanges, but a shortage of localized and easily accessible information, and a deep dependence of many rural residents on 'information brokers' such as agricultural extension workers and shop owners. Can ICT support existing practices of information sharing among rural residents, when these practices are largely based on face-to-face encounters and passive reception of information? We argue that in such an environment, ICT should build on existing social habits even if less than ideal, rather than trying to transform them, and we outline a possible way to do so.},

To investigate children's perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences, we held two co-design sessions with 12 children ages 7-12. Children first reviewed and redesigned an existing mobile monitoring application. Next, they designed ways children could use monitoring software when they encounter mobile risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content). Results showed that children acknowledged safety needs and accepted certain parental controls. They preferred and designed controls that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. Our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from.},

abstract = {Background: Mobile technologies are a useful platform for the delivery of health behavior interventions. Yet little work has been done to create a rigorous and standardized process for the design of mobile health (mHealth) apps. This project sought to explore the use of the Information Systems Research (ISR) framework as guide for the design of mHealth apps. Methods: Our work was guided by the ISR framework which is comprised of 3 cycles: Relevance, Rigor and Design. In the Relevance cycle, we conducted 5 focus groups with 33 targeted end-users. In the Rigor cycle, we performed a review to identify technology-based interventions for meeting the health prevention needs of our target population. In the Design Cycle, we employed usability evaluation methods to iteratively develop and refine mock-ups for a mHealth app. Results: Through an iterative process, we identified barriers and facilitators to the use of mHealth technology for HIV prevention for high-risk MSM, developed 'use cases' and identified relevant functional content and features for inclusion in a design document to guide future app development. Findings from our work support the use of the ISR framework as a guide for designing future mHealth apps. Discussion: Results from this work provide detailed descriptions of the user-centered design and system development and have heuristic value for those venturing into the area of technology-based intervention work. Findings from this study support the use of the ISR framework as a guide for future mHealth app development. Conclusion: Use of the ISR framework is a potentially useful approach for the design of a mobile app that incorporates end-users' design preferences.},

abstract = {We describe self-reported strategies used by persons living with HIV/AIDS in Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland to manage common HIV-related symptoms. A questionnaire asked participants to list three to six symptoms they had recently experienced, the care strategies they had used to make them better, where they had learned the strategy, and to rate the perceived effectiveness of the strategy. Data were collected in 2002 from 743 persons. The self-care management strategies were coded into eight categories: medications, complementary treatments, self-comforting, changing diet, seeking help, exercise, spiritual care, and daily thoughts/activities. Overall, participants reported medications as the most frequently occurring management strategy and the most effective. A very small inventory of behavioral strategies was available to participants to help them manage their HIV-related symptoms.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to redefine 'user participation in design' and to articulate new roles for designers in order to transform design processes. The term 'Design Participation' was introduced in the 1971 Design Research Society conference. The main focus of this paper is to suggest ways to tackle three areas that have been neglected over 30 years of Design Participation development, namely: the aesthetic quality of design practice, the collaborative relationship of design research and participatory design thinking. The paper is a reflection by a professional designer developed through the experience of working with different groups in action research projects and these concrete case studies are used to illustrate the developing theory. Three areas of challenges were identified and the overall aim was to facilitate innovative collaboration and create platforms for social inclusion in design practice. Addressing these challenges, it is essential to reconsider the roles of designers (design developer, facilitator and generator) in order to achieve user participation in design. However, in order to avoid tokenism, the most important thing is to practice these roles as tactics of Design Participation.

Participants completed a survey of pain (pain presence, intensity, locations, and duration) and disability (Sickness Impact Profile). Sixty percent of the sample reported pain; Black and White adults did not differ on any pain variable. In structural equation models controlling for socioeconomic factors and health, pain did not mediate the relationship between race and disability. Race moderated the pain-disability relationship; pain was more associated with disability among Whites than Blacks. This study highlights the need for greater understanding of health disparities between Black and White older adults as they relate to pain and disability.},

abstract = {Objective:To identify family members? and visitors? needs with relation to the design of a hospital room.Background:There is a trend toward incorporating family zones in hospital patient rooms in order to improve patient satisfaction and encourage family caregivers to stay longer and overnight.Method:A mixed-method study was employed. Interviews of patients and family caregivers were conducted to understand opportunities to improve hospital room designs based on recent experiences. Features intended to support short-term and overnight visitors were embedded in five full-scale simulated room design concepts. Small groups of family caregivers and patients toured two room design concepts and reacted real time to room features. A grounded theory approach was employed to identify emerging themes.Results:A theoretical design framework is developed for the needs of family members and visitors for a range of time periods. This framework is founded upon desires to help make the patient feel more comfortable. There are various levels of helping the patient feel more comfortable, including visiting, keeping company, providing support, providing assistance, and being a caregiver. Beyond this core need, family members and visitors must take care of their own needs in order to feel comfortable in the hospital room. Activities associated with these needs include sitting, relaxing, eating, working, tending to daily needs, and resting overnight.Conclusions:Potential implications for architects, healthcare planners, and interior space designers are described. Design and renovation guidance for the hospital room environment in order to support the needs and expectations of families and visitors is provided.},

abstract = {Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. Given the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice. The American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mislabeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. Hospital routines to encourage and support the initiation and sustaining of exclusive breastfeeding should be based on the American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed WHO/UNICEF "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding." National strategies supported by the US Surgeon General's Call to Action, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The Joint Commission are involved to facilitate breastfeeding practices in US hospitals and communities. Pediatricians play a critical role in their practices and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and thus should be knowledgeable about the health risks of not breastfeeding, the economic benefits to society of breastfeeding, and the techniques for managing and supporting the breastfeeding dyad. The "Business Case for Breastfeeding" details how mothers can maintain lactation in the workplace and the benefits to employers who facilitate this practice.},

abstract = {Over the past century, educational psychologists and researchers have posited many theories to explain how individuals learn, i.e. how they acquire, organize and deploy knowledge and skills.The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century andnote that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its na{\"{i}}ve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and as a result of the emergence of computer technologies especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciencesbecame more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview ofthesciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.The Encyclopedia of theSciences of Learningprovides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction, pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the Encyclopedia provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical termsprovides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications. TheEncyclopedia also contains biographical entries ofindividuals who have substantially contributed to the sciences of learning; the entries are written by a distinguished panel of researchers in the various fields of the learning sciences.},

The findings from the first stage of the study indicate that M-PESA affects the economic outcomes of community members, both users and non-users of MPESA, through direct and externality effects, and identify 11 economic effects within the broad categories of local economic expansion, security, capital accumulation and business environment after 2.5 years of M-PESA's use in these communities. The research also shows that effects were not visible in all the study communities and among all the population segments within the communities; they tended to be influenced by gender and geographic location of the communities. Also, the effects were not always perceived as mutually exclusive, but as interwoven with each other to produce overall community effects.},

Analysing these practices with literature on power, participation and realist social theory this article explores the power dynamics, mechanisms and impacts within co-production and co-design processes. Two case studies were evaluated using qualitative longitudinal methods: an experience-based co-design project within hospital-based breast cancer services was followed from initiation to completion, alongside a local government innovation team that used co-production and co-design techniques to enable person-centred policies and services. The two cases illustrate how co-production and co-design techniques involve facilitating, managing and coordinating a complex set of psychological, social, cultural and institutional interactions. Whilst existing power relations can be challenged in different ways, constant critical reflective practice and dialogue is essential to facilitate more equal relational processes within these techniques, and to institute changes at individual, local community and organisational levels.},

abstract = {Research in human computer interaction (HCI) covers both technological and human behavioural concerns. As a consequence, the contributions made in HCI research tend to be aware to either engineering or the social sciences. In HCI the purpose of practical research contributions is to reveal unknown insights about human behaviour and its relationship to technology. Practical research methods normally used in HCI include formal experiments, field experiments, field studies, interviews, focus groups, surveys, usability tests, case studies, diary studies, ethnography, contextual inquiry, experience sampling, and automated data collection. In this paper, we report on our experience using the evaluation methods focus groups, surveys and interviews and how we adopted these methods to develop artefacts: either interface's design or information and technological systems. Four projects are examples of the different methods application to gather information about user's wants, habits, practices, concerns and preferences. The goal was to build an understanding of the attitudes and satisfaction of the people who might interact with a technological artefact or information system. Conversely, we intended to design for information systems and technological applications, to promote resilience in organisations (a set of routines that allow to recover from obstacles) and user's experiences. Organisations can here also be viewed within a system approach, which means that the system perturbations even failures could be characterized and improved. The term resilience has been applied to everything from the real estate, to the economy, sports, events, business, psychology, and more. In this study, we highlight that resilience is also made up of a number of different skills and abilities (self-awareness, creating meaning from other experiences, self-efficacy, optimism, and building strong relationships) that are a few foundational ingredients, which people should use along with the process of enhancing an organisation's resilience. Resilience enhances knowledge of resources available to people confronting existing problems.},

abstract = {Critical Theory (via critical design) could enable designers and users to devise products and systems with radically different roles and functions. A challenge for participatory design is how designers and users understanding of the space of possibilities may limit what is designed. In suggesting provocative alternatives, the conceptual designs produced by critical design may allow designers and users to explore a broader space of possibilities and develop innovative products and systems. In my research 3, I have developed a methodology based on these principles. This use of (critical) artefacts to both express and transform understanding has parallels with the use of critiques in Critical Theory. However criticisms of Critical Theory, notably elitism, are also applicable to critical design and are counter to the democratic values of participatory design. I will discuss these issues below with reference to my use of critical artefacts in participatory design activities to foster human-centred innovation.},

In such settings empathizing with others is crucial in understanding the experience of living with specific conditions, or in being sensitive to the concerns and emotions of potentially vulnerable participants.

This workshop therefore aims to build an interdisciplinary community of researchers, designers and practitioners to share and discuss their work and the challenges they encountered when establishing empathic relationships within health or care contexts. We will work towards developing a richer conceptual and practical understanding of empathic engagement and design methods in this context to support and shape an agenda for future research.},

In each country, a group of users participated in requirements gathering sessions that were aimed at developing design ideas for overcoming country-specific usability problems. Using qualitative content analysis, it was found that in each country some specific interaction activities were considered more when participants generated design ideas for country-specific usability problems. It was also found that even for similar usability problems, participants suggested country-specific solutions. Therefore, it is suggested that participation of local users in the design process should not be limited to identification of usability problems, but should also include the problem-solving phase that is usually a phase in design and development processes in which requirements gathering techniques are being used. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Beyond this, we also used role-play both as an additional feedback channel and a design tool. Our results demonstrate the combined benefits of implementing creative methods for effective human-to-technology and human-to-human communication in ways that enable new forms of expression; and highlight the importance of using role play in HCI4D contexts.

abstract = {Potential enteric bacterial pathogens in 60 HIV-positive patients with chronic diarrhoea in rural communities of the Limpopo Province, South Africa, were identified using standard microbiological methods. The Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method was employed to determine antibiograms of isolated bacteria. Results revealed that diarrhoeagenic bacterial agents were isolated from 48 (80{\%}) of the 60 HIV-positive patients with diarrhoea. Forty-four (73.3{\%}) and 16 (26.7{\%}) of the 60 patients were female and male respectively in the age range of 17-55 years with a mean of 34 years. Bacterial pathogens isolated comprised Campylobacter species (20.0{\%}), Plesiomonas shigelloides (16.6{\%}), Aeromonas species (13.3{\%}), and Escherichia coli, Shigella and Salmonella species (10.0{\%} each). No attempts were made to isolate parasites, fungi, or viruses. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles revealed resistance of the isolates to ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin. However, all (100{\%}) of P. shigelloides and Salmonella species were sensitive to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Most isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, indicating the usefulness of these drugs, although antibiograms may not always correlate with clinical usefulness.},

This paper reports on a process that involved Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) staff and mothers in the design of technological interventions that focus on enhancing communication between mothers and staff in the NICU context. We used the co-design approach, focusing on identifying methods that ensure participants fully participate in the design process despite facing co-design dynamics such as power imbalances and conflict. Our results demonstrate the benefits of choosing an approach that focuses on building trust with stakeholders before delving into co-design process and empowering participants thus enabling them to fully participate in a design process. We argue that while working with multiple stakeholders, co-design readiness is dependent on methodological choice, stakeholders' relationship with the researcher and stakeholders' cohesion.},

For every woman who dies of pregnancy-related causes, an estimated 20 women experience acute or chronic morbidity. Maternal morbidity adversely affects families, communities and societies. Maternal morbidity has multiple causes, with duration ranging from acute to chronic, severity ranging from transient to permanent and with a range of diagnosis and treatment options. This article addresses six selected relatively neglected aspects of maternal morbidity to illustrate the range of acute and chronic morbidities that can affect women related to pregnancy and childbearing that are prevalent in developing countries: anaemia, maternal depression, infertility, fistula, uterine rupture and scarring and genital and uterine prolapse. Based on this review, recommendations to reduce maternal morbidity include: expand the focus of safe motherhood to explicitly include morbidity; improve data on incidence and prevalence of maternal morbidity; link mortality and morbidity outcomes and programming; increase access to facility- and community-based maternal health care and reproductive health care; and address the antecedents to poor maternal health through a lifecycle approach.},

Financial reports are produced to assess healthcare organizations on some key performance indicators to steer their healthcare delivery. Similarly, at a clinical level, data on patient status is conveyed by means of textual descriptions to facilitate patient review, shift handover and care transitions. Likewise, patients are informed about data on their health status and treatments via text, in the form of reports or via ehealth platforms by their doctors. Unfortunately, such text is the outcome of a highly labour-intensive process if it is done by healthcare professionals. It is also prone to incompleteness, subjectivity and hard to scale up to different domains, wider audiences and varying communication purposes. Data-to-text is a recent breakthrough technology in artificial intelligence which automatically generates natural language in the form of text or speech from data. This chapter provides a survey of data-to-text technology, with a focus on how it can be deployed in a healthcare setting. It will (1) give an up-to-date synthesis of data-to-text approaches, (2) give a categorized overview of use cases in healthcare, (3) seek to make a strong case for evaluating and implementing data-to-text in a healthcare setting, and (4) highlight recent research challenges.},

@article{Guillaume2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the first weeks of hospitalization, premature babies and their parents encounter difficulties in establishing early bonds and interactions. Only a few studies have explored what caregivers can do to meet parents' needs in relation to these interactions and help optimize them. This study sought to explore parents' perception of these first interactions and to identify the actions of caregivers that help or hinder its development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Prospective study, qualitative discourse analysis of 60 face-to-face interviews conducted with 30 mothers and 30 fathers of infants born before 32 weeks of gestation (mean ± SD: 27 ± 2 weeks of gestational age), during their child's stay in one out of three NICUs in France. Interviews explored parental experience, from before birth up to the first month of life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Data analysis uncovered two main themes, which were independent of parents' geographical or cultural origin but differed between mothers and fathers. First, fathers described the bond with their child as composed more of words and looks and involving distance, while mothers experienced the bond more physically. Secondly, two aspects of the caregivers' influence were decisive: nurses' caring attitude towards baby and parents, and their communication with parents, which reduced stress and made interactions with the baby possible. This communication appeared to be the locus of a supportive and fulfilling encounter between parents and caregivers that reinforced parents' perception of a developing bond.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: At birth and during the first weeks in the NICU, the creation of a bond between mothers and fathers and their premature baby is rooted in their relationship with the caregivers. Nurses' caring attitude and regular communication adapted to specific needs are perceived by parents as necessary preconditions for parents' interaction and development of a bond with their baby. These results might allow NICU staff to provide better support to parents and facilitate the emergence of a feeling of parenthood.},

Activity Theory offers a holistic and contextual method of discovery that can be used to support qualitative and interpretative research. Activity Theory is particularly relevant in situations that have a significant historical and cultural context and where the participants, their purposes and their tools are in a process of rapid and constant change. The paper begins with an overview and background to the theory. Then, after explicating the practical value of its use, the paper concludes with a summary of some recent research which has used the method for analysis and discovery. The key concept of Activity Theory arises through an understanding of human consciousness as it has been shaped by experience and the subjectivity of human awareness.},

There exists a body of instruments that measure a range of maternal characteristics, such as maternal confidence and self-efficacy. It remains unclear if any of these assessments can be used to measure maternal functioning, which may be a direct indication of potential hazards to the offspring. Accurate assessment of functioning would also aid in identifying women who are struggling in the maternal role. In order to assess whether commonly used maternal assessments extend into the realm of functioning, it is necessary to have an appropriate definition. Therefore, the aims of this analysis are to (1) present a new, patient-centered definition of maternal functional status and (2) evaluate select maternal assessments against this definition.},

abstract = {At the core of Participatory Design is the direct involvement of people in the co-design of tools, products, environments, busi-nesses, and social institutions. In particular, Participatory Design has developed a diverse collection of principles and practices to encourage and support this direct involvement. Many of the design tools and techniques generated to further this process have become standard practice for the design and development of information and communications technologies and increasingly other kinds of products and services. These design tools and techniques include various kinds of design workshops in which participants collabora-tively envision future practices and products; scenarios, personas and related tools that enable people to represent their own activities to others (rather than having others do this for them); various forms of mock-ups, prototypes and enactment of current and future activ-ities used to coordinate the design process; and iterative prototyp-ing so that participants can interrogate developing designs and ground their design conversations in the desired outcomes of the design process and the context in which these will be used. 1 Partici-patory Design has also pioneered and developed some of the basic research questions, methods, and agendas that have recently been taken up by design research in more traditional design environ-ments (e.g., innovation through participation). 2 Increasingly, participatory designers have sought to develop processes to enable active stakeholder participation in the design of the tools, environments, businesses, and social institutions in which these information and communication technologies are embedded. These widened contexts have been reflected in the themes of recent Participatory Design conferences and in the substantive focus of the research presented in them. Participatory Design: A Brief Overview The beginnings of contemporary Participatory Design lie primarily in the restless and exhilarating days of the various social, political and civil rights movements the 1960s and 1970s. People in many western societies demanded an increased say in the decisions that affected many different aspects of their lives. Some designers and design researchers participated very directly in these activities and},

Data from interviews identified knowledge and support as major themes. Prototypes were developed (N = 14) and informed 168 SMS. Pregnant women (N = 326) thought three SMS/week were about right (50.2 {\%}) and preferred three SMS/week throughout pregnancy (71.9 {\%}).

The Study Design: Eighteen NICU parents from different hospitals in the city of Isfahan were selected for in-depth interviews. Qualitative content analysis included open coding, categorization Original Research Article Heidari et al.; BJMMR, 7(1): 45-51, 2015; Article no.BJMMR.2015.306 46 and abstraction of data. Results: Data analysis identified stress provoking factors for NICU parents in four categories as confusion in nurse-parent, nurse-physician communication, negligence in physician-parent communication, inappropriate nurse-physician communication, and the medical diagnosis communication process. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that NICU parent presence was very low. It is necessary for the hospital management and NICU staff to develop communication skills training sessions for less stressful parent experiences in NICU. Moreover, the Ministry of Health should authorize policy development and guidelines to improve relationship between medical staff, physicians, nurses and NICU families aimed at better neonatal outcomes.},

Nurses are key sources of support to guide parents in their journey. From prenatal counseling to discharge preparations, parents who partner with nurses and the health care team are better able to assume their roles as parents. Overcoming the stress associated with NICU care is possible with creative partnerships that empower parents to build self-confidence and competence in their role as parents. Interventions are suggested to guide staff to assess individual family's needs and structure care delivery to improve patient outcomes.

abstract = {Telemedicine and e-health systems have been proposed as a support tool, to monitor and evaluate HIV/AIDS management strategies. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of telemedicine and e-health systems for HIV/AIDS in South Africa as a basis for developing an e-health toolkit for anti-retroviral treatment (ART). An initial literature review and a subsequent interactive networking approach were chosen to identify telemedicine and e-health systems, projects and services for HIV/AIDS and ART facilities in low-resource settings and under-served areas. The literature review produced little useful information. In contrast, the face-to-face interviews and the focus group discussions provided useful information about projects and systems which had not been published. The meetings involved 1 - 5 people per session, about 30 people in total. The review showed that there were some plans for telemedicine and e-health implementation in South Africa. However, there was no all-inclusive ICT-based system in place for AIDS treatment there. With the exception of the major health information systems and electronic patient record systems, none of the telemedicine and e-health systems identified in the review were ready to be deployed across the country as a whole.},

abstract = {One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG-4) is to reduce child mortality by up to two-thirds by 2015. In most developing countries, a higher proportion of neonatal deaths are observed. We quantify the causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality at a rural hospital. A retrospective review of consecutive neonatal admissions to Empangeni Hospital, between January and December 2005, was conducted. Of 1,573 admissions, male babies made up 57.8{\%} of admissions and 63{\%} of the deaths. The most common causes of admission were birth asphyxia (38.2{\%}), prematurity (23.5{\%}), and infection (21{\%}). The average length of stay was 9.2 days (SD 12 days). The overall mortality rate was 13.8{\%} but higher (23.4{\%}) among the referred babies. Admission and death rates of low birthweight babies ({\textless}2,500g) were 53{\%} and 84{\%}, respectively. Two-thirds (67.7{\%}) of those babies who died were born preterm. Over half (56.6{\%}) of the deaths took place within the first three days of life. Logistic regression showed that extremely low birthweight (OR=13.923, 95{\%} CI:5.759; 33.656), male sex of the babies (OR=1.633, 95{\%} CI:1.132; 2.356), and preterm delivery (OR=2.975, 95{\%} CI: 1.296; 6.836) were significant predictors of neonatal death. A substantial proportion of neonatal mortality occurs in the hospital neonatal unit. Asphyxia, prematurity, low birthweight and neonatal infection are the leading cause of neonatal hospitalisation and deaths. Several simple and effective interventions exist to minimise neonatal admissions and deaths in South Africa.},

abstract = {“Out there” is increasingly becoming a topic of concern in HCI. Thanks to various clarion calls, researchers in the field are turning their attention to technology-mediated activities that are shaped less by Euro-American sensibilities and de- fined more by how they are culturally and geographically dis- tinct. Fieldwork and ethnography researchers, for instance, are beginning to investigate ICT use at religious and spiritual sites, by the socially excluded and disenfranchised, and by people in developing regions. In this paper, I concentrate on the latter focus on development to reflect on HCI's disciplinary turn “out there”. Specifically, I take the following three themes as common rhetorical devices in such work: (i) the network, (ii) difference and (iii) complexity. Through examples, I discuss how each of these themes has been mobilised. I then use mate- rials from anthropology, science and technology studies, and to a lesser extent geography and postcolonial studies to com- plicate and in some cases question the interpretative frames that are being applied. Thus, my hope is that this paper is seen as a thought piece that deepens our thinking around HCI's efforts to look “out there” by paying critical attention to what is going on “in here”. Author},

In this study, however, we found that the medical information for pregnant women in Denmark is located in a number of different places, that midwives and doctors spend a considerable amount of time administrating data, and that consultations are felt to be rather inefficient. This paper describes these problems and some solutions. We explore the idea of providing each woman with a digital artifact, called the Memory Stone. The goal is to supply them with tools to collect and review clinical and personal information concerning their pregnancies. The paper discusses: (1) the user-centered methodology for development of a personal device for health care information, (2) the design and evaluation of prototypes, and (3) critical issues concerning the introduction of novel personal ICT in a health care setting. The main focus is on the experiences and interests of the individual pregnant woman in the study. Several insights were gained into more general pervasive health care issues, including technical and ethical ones as well as safety and security concerns.},

abstract = {The problem of sample size usually confronts the research worker in the initial stages of an investigation. Many short methods have been used for determining sample size such as extracting the square root of the number of boxes or taking a 10 percent sample. While these techniques are easy to use nevertheless they are not based upon a statistical evaluation of the experiment. Sample size in an experiment is often dictated by the amount of time, money and labor available but even under such conditions it is possible to evaluate the precision of the experiment when the number of replications is dictated by necessity.},

However, mixed methods research focusing on which groups are vulnerable, and their speci¢c psychosocial needs, is rarely conducted. This study uses historical policy discourse analysis to identify the origins of contemporary social categories related to vulnerability in Nepal, speci¢cally caste. The policy analysis is employed to interpret cross-sectional epidemiological¢ndingsfrom a sample of 316 adults. Analyses test the relationship between caste and psychological morbidity, assessed with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), including potential mediators. Low caste (Dalit/Nepali) groups were found to have a 53,3 percent prevalence of psychological morbidity compared with 28,2 percent prevalence among other caste and ethnic groups (odds ratio 2,91, 95{\%} con¢dence interval 1,71{\^{}} 4,96). Income and stressful life events partially mediate the relationship between caste and psychological morbidity.These ¢ndings are interpreted in relation to themes from the policy analysis including restrictions in social interactions, access to resources, social control and punishment, social mobility and gender relations. The study concludes with recommendations for addressing the needs of vulnerable social groups in post con{\pounds}ict settings.},

If the experience of infertility is different for women and men, the next question is whether women and men cope differently. Meta-analytic procedures were used to review the empirical evidence (1966-1995) on gender differences in coping with infertility among heterosexual married couples; all studies used a standardized coping measure [The Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised (Folkman et al., 1986)]. Significant gender differences were found for half the strategies studied: Women used the strategies of Seeking Social Support, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem-Solving, and Positive Reappraisal to a greater degree than their partners. The findings suggest that coping at both the individual and the couple level be considered in the treatment of infertile couples and that gender be considered before planning an intervention.},

According to SIT, there are five principles that mediate the effectiveness of cooperation: positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction patterns, social skills and group processing. First, we theoretically ground six challenging group dynamics encountered in a previous study. Next, we introduce SIT and describe how we applied each of the five mediating principles in a new case study in which 49 children aged 9 to 10 were involved in a series of co-design sessions. Afterwards, we present our findings and reflect upon the SIT inspired co-design procedure. Finally we touch upon topics for further research and we make a call for more research on SIT in the Child Computer Interaction (CCI) community.},

abstract = {Background.  Accurate child mortality data are essential to plan health interventions to reduce child deaths.   Objectives.  To review the deaths of children aged {\textless}5 years during 2011 in the Metro West geographical service area (GSA) of the Western Cape Province (WC), South Africa, from routine data sources.   Methods.  A retrospective study of under-5 deaths in the Metro West GSA was done using the WC Local Mortality Surveillance System (LMSS), the Child Healthcare Problem Identification Programme (Child PIP) and the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP), and linking where possible.   Results.  The LMSS reported 700 under-5 deaths, Child PIP 99 and PPIP 252, with an under-5 mortality rate of 18 deaths per 1 000 live births. The leading causes of death were pneumonia (25{\%}), gastroenteritis (10{\%}), prematurity (9{\%}) and injuries (9{\%}). There were 316 in-hospital deaths (45{\%}) and 384 out-of-hospital deaths (55{\%}). Among children aged {\textless}1 year, there were significantly more pneumonia deaths out of hospital than in hospital (144 (49{\%}) v. 16 (6{\%});  p {\textless}0.001). Among children aged 1 - 4 years there were significantly more injury-related deaths out of hospital than in hospital (43 (47{\%}) v. 4 (9{\%});  p {\textless}0.001). In 56 (15{\%}) of the cases of out-of-hospital death the child had visited a public healthcare facility within 1 week of death. Thirty-six (64{\%}) of these children had died of pneumonia or gastroenteritis.  Conclusions.  Health interventions targeted at reducing under-5 deaths from pneumonia, gastroenteritis, prematurity and injuries need to be implemented across the service delivery platform in the Metro West GSA. It is important to consider all routine data sources in the evaluation of child mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The ability to capture the complexities of healthcare practices and the quick turnaround of findings make rapid ethnographies appealing to the healthcare sector, where changing organisational climates and priorities require actionable findings at strategic time points. Despite methodological advancement, there continue to be challenges in the implementation of rapid ethnographies concerning sampling, the interpretation of findings and management of field research. The purpose of this review was to explore the benefits and challenges of using rapid ethnographies to inform healthcare organisation and delivery and identify areas that require improvement. METHODS This was a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the articles. We developed the search strategy using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Settingframework and searched for peer-reviewed articles in MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, Web of Science and ProQuest Central. We included articles that reported findings from rapid ethnographies in healthcare contexts or addressing issues related to health service use. RESULTS 26 articles were included in the review. We found an increase in the use of rapid ethnographies in the last 2‰years. We found variability in terminology and developed a typology to clarify conceptual differences. The studies generated findings that could be used to inform policy and practice. The main limitations of the studies were: the poor quality of reporting of study designs, mainly data analysis methods, and lack of reflexivity. CONCLUSIONS Rapid ethnographies have the potential to generate findings that can inform changes in healthcare practices in a timely manner, but greater attention needs to be paid to the reflexive interpretation of findings and the description of research methods.

abstract = {In delivering health care, an effective teamwork can immediately and positively affect patient safety and outcome. The need for effective teams is increasing due to increasing co-morbidities and increasing complexity of specialization of care. Time has gone when a doctor or a dentist or any other health practitioner in whatsoever health organization would be able to solely deliver a quality care that satisfies his or her patients. The evolution in health care and a global demand for quality patient care necessitate a parallel health care professional development with a great focus on patient centred teamwork approach. This can only be achieved by placing the patient in the centre of care and through sharing a wide based culture of values and principles. This will help forming and developing an effective team able to deliver exceptional care to the patients. Aiming towards this goal, motivation of team members should be backed by strategies and practical skills in order to achieve goals and overcome challenges.

abstract = {If there's one thing one can expect from information technology deployments in devel- oping countries–it's the unexpected. From 2007-2010, I combined my skills as a software developer with ethnographic methods to observe the use of information technology in a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Southwest Uganda. This NGO subsidizes health facilities by paying for sexually transmitted infection treatment on the basis of claims sub- mitted after the patient consultation, targeting treatment of 99,000 clients between 2006- 2011. The program addresses a real need - in the program area, a household survey found that while 39{\%} of the population reported STI symptoms, only 1/3 sought care. However, management of this program is information intensive. As part of my studies, I imple- mented and tested Claim Mobile, a smartphone-based data collection application intended to reduce claims processing delays and improve health facility engagement. I successfully tested Claim Mobile in Summer 2008, processing 35 claims for two health facilities, and then discontinued its deployment six months later, when I decided that integration and scale-up of the technology would be problematic for the changing context the NGO. New priorities and new program management practices revealed ‘invisible constraints' that a redesign of Claim Mobile would not accommodate},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active parent involvement in caring for their infants in the neonatal care unit is thought to improve parent-infant attachment and to moderate the psychological stress for parents, but few recent studies have examined parent visiting patterns and participation in infant caregiving. The study purposes were to describe the frequency and duration of parent visiting and participation in infant caregiving activities, and to identify parent and infant factors associated with parental participation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Parental visiting frequency, duration, and participation in social, cleaning, and feeding activities with their infant (n=110) were recorded on 12 days during a 3-month period in a tertiary neonatal unit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mothers visited more frequently (85{\%} vs 45{\%} of possible days) and for longer than fathers, and visited less frequently if the infant had other siblings, if the infant was over age 1 month, or if fathers made fewer visits. Fathers visited less frequently if the infant was over age 7 days and more frequently if the mothers visited more frequently. All mothers and most (96{\%}) fathers carried out social activities, such as talking, stroking or holding, during their visits. Over 75 percent of mothers engaged in infant cleaning and feeding activities during visits in contrast with less than 20 percent of fathers. Mothers' participation in infant feeding was best predicted by the duration of their visit and their participation in infant cleaning. Fathers' participation in infant feeding was only related to their participation in infant cleaning.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Significant differences were found in this neonatal unit between mothers' and fathers' visiting patterns and infant caregiving activities. Neonatal unit staff should consider factors that may influence parental visiting and explore strategies to improve parental involvement in caregiving.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. The proliferation of mobile devices in a resource-constrained setting like Malawi has created an enabling environment for the deployment of mobile health (mHealth) applications. These applications offer various services such as maternal and child health, nutrition, and HIV management in different localised places in Malawi. Unfortunately, most of these applications are pilot projects that are not centrally managed by the government. The downside of this approach is that most projects are not scaled up once they are completed. As a result, there is no continuity of the mHealth projects. Because of a lack of coordination, lessons learned from one projects are not propagated to other projects. The lack of sustainability of mHealth projects wastes a lot of resources. The comprehensive literature study and semistructured interviews in public health and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector in Malawi further highlighted the following challenges: poor infrastructure, lack of proper policy and regulation, lack of human skills and development, lack of financial resources, and poor ICT governance. Guiding policies were subsequently proposed to circumvent the aforementioned challenges. An ICT model is therefore proposed to effectively manage the sustainability of mHealth projects in Malawi. The proposed model has the following phases: solution requirement, strategy for project execution, implementation of the solution, and monitoring and evaluation. The model was further validated by 5 experts selected from different areas of expertise including mHealth application developers, ICT policymakers, and public health practitioners. Results show that the model is relevant, useful, and applicable within the setting of Malawi. It is therefore envisaged that the model can be used by policymakers, decision makers, and ICT implementers for the smooth utilisation of resources and the sustainability of mHealth applications in Malawi.},

Patients and users have attended stakeholder events, participated in discovery interviews, completed surveys, mapped healthcare processes and even designed new hospitals with healthcare staff. However, to date efforts have not necessarily focused on the patient's experience, beyond asking what was good and what was not. Questions were not asked to find out details of what the experience was or should be like ("experience" being different from "attitudes") and the information then systematically used to co-design services with patients. Knowledge of the experience, held only by the patient, is unique and precious. In this paper, attention is drawn to the burgeoning discipline of the design sciences and experience-based design, in which the traditional view of the user as a passive recipient of a product or service has begun to give way to the new view of users as integral to the improvement and innovation process.},

abstract = {As technology progressively pervades all aspects of our lives, members of the HCI community are engaging with increasingly sensitive contexts in their research - for example, end of life, genocide, computer-mediated communication under oppressive regimes. The considerations generated by research in such contexts can go well beyond those addressed by generic ethical approval processes and institutional practice. Whilst it is standard to ensure that the wellbeing of participants is taken into account in research design and the ethical approval process, it is much less common for the researcher's own emotional wellbeing to be considered explicitly. This paper describes the role that a researcher's emotions may play in research, and the impact which research in sensitive contexts can have on researchers' emotional wellbeing and on research validity. A qualitative survey is described which investigated the support mechanisms which HCI researchers have in place in case they are distressed/troubled as a result of their research. The results of the survey are used, in combination with insights into how other disciplines address the topic, to synthesize suggestions for ways in which the HCI community can proactively incorporate consideration for the emotional wellbeing of the researcher into the research process.},

abstract = {There are many sources of change within the domain of home care. People have changing needs, beliefs, and preferences regarding their care plan and how they might want to interact with existing and emerging home care technologies. The devices and services available to the user are likely to change over time depending on a person's capabilities or location within the home and the current devices and services available. The resulting interaction methods can therefore also change in accordance with the room location, available devices or displays, or preferred modalities. Home care systems therefore need to offer configuration possibilities that support this change. Computer systems offer methods and tools to support configuration in the short term, but do not provide mechanisms for supporting configuration over both short and long term. This paper presents an approach that addresses this issue in the home care domain by integrating methods for interaction requirements engineering with system support for turning those requirements into a working configuration. Both the methods and system support are designed to address a gradual process of change -- 'interaction evolution' in home care. We present the key features of our approach using a home care scenario and consider our progress to date in implementing and validating the approach.},

This paper presents the results of a systematic review of the published and unpublished evidence regarding the long-term economic implications of preterm birth and low birth weight for various sectors of the economy and for individuals. The paper highlights the variable methodological quality of the bulk of long-term economic studies of preterm birth and low birth weight and suggests ways in which these methodological limitations can be overcome. The paper reveals that preterm birth and low birth weight can result in substantial costs to the health sector following the infant's initial discharge from hospital. It can also impose a substantial burden on special education and social services, on families and carers of the infants and on society generally. In addition to the costs identified by the literature, preterm birth and low birth weight can have other long-term consequences that require evaluation from an economic perspective.},

DESIGN: Survey using a short structured interview SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Families of babies cared for in a regional neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: Eighty six respondents, no refusals. Sixty three had visited during a ward round, and 13 had come in especially for the round. About half had overheard conversations about other babies or thought discussions about their baby had been overheard. Concerns about these experiences were only expressed by respondents who had actually experienced overhearing. Parents and families had little information about the ward round, held diverse views, and expressed different priorities. They described a mixture of concerns about communication, practicalities, and issues of ethics and principle. Confidentiality was a matter of concern for some, but many parents expected some sharing of information between families on the unit. CONCLUSIONS: Units should consider: the information they have for parents about ward rounds; the possibility that consultations may be overheard; the opportunities for parents to communicate with the clinical team.},

@incollection{Moura2010,
abstract = {It is not unusual that a chapter on confl ict management, which is about, generally speaking, helping people or organizations that are in confl ict with each other to deal with their differ-ences, opens up with this statement (Moore, 1986 cited in Gordon, 1966): All societies, communities, organizations, and interpersonal relationships experience confl ict at one time or another in the process of day-to-day interaction. Confl ict is not necessarily bad, abnormal, or dysfunctional; it is a fact of life. Typically, a confl ict situation results from resource shortage and antagonistic feeling. Confl icts may arise between individuals, between groups of individuals and between organizations. Confl ict situations between people are subjective, meaning that although objective reasons may exist, confl ict only breaks out if those reasons are perceived. Confl icts between people may trigger out organizational confl icts for the simple reason that organiza-tions are (still) governed by people. However, organizational confl icts may have other root reasons, for example resource interdependency. A common defi nition of confl ict is a proc-ess that begins whenever an individual or a group feels negatively affected by another individual or group. In other words, people are in confl ict anytime one's actions obstruct or by any means, make other's performance, less effi cient. Individual conflicts exist in all human relations and those within the construction activity are no exception. Due to the great diversity of people involved in construc-tion projects and to the enormous variety of situations emerging from the construction process, individual conflicts in this activity deserve particular attention. Groton (1997) found that conflicts between people in construction arise as a result of poor interpersonal skills, inefficient communication, lack of responsiveness and unethical or opportunist behaviour. Conflicts of this nature may remain within the individual sphere of people involved or build up to the organizations they work for if not adequately handled. This may easily develop into organizational conflicts, affecting several organizations participating in a construction project. On the other hand, because organizations act through individuals, then confl ict events emanate from key actors within the organizations, due to their different perceptions on a particular aspect about which they are unable to agree. This applies both to group confl icts within an organization (for example, inter-department confl icts within a contrac-tor's organization) and to confl icts affecting several organizations working together in a construction project (for example, between the owner and the contractor). Beyond people issues mentioned above, Groton (1997) suggested two main identifi able group causes for organization confl icts: project uncertainty and process problems. Examples of the former 17 Managing Stakeholders Confl icts Helder Moura and Jos{\'{e}} Cardoso Teixeira Managing Stakeholders Confl icts 287 are pre-existing conditions and outside forces and of the latter are incomplete project scope defi nition and poor performance. In view of the above, the following defi nition for a confl ict applies: an interaction of independent people who acknowledge different objectives, wishes and values in the other part, capable of interfering with their own. In this statement, there are three ingredients that seem to be present in every confl ict: interdependence, perception (at least by one part) and antagonism. In fact, confl ict has always been present in organizations taking part in construction ventures since ancient times. One of the fi rst reported confl ict management practice between construction stakeholders took place in Ancient Greece (some authors identify the fi rst civil engineer in European history as the Greek Eupalinos, responsible for the construction of the Samos island tunnel in the year 550 BC), where, after public inter-views for selecting the contractor of a new statue or building, citizens were informed about actual progress and the cost of the construction project. This and other type of measures related to confl ict avoidance tactics were also used in Ancient Rome, where construction contracts ought to defi ne technical specifi cations, materials, guarantees or payment schedules, in order to adequately distribute risk between the owner and the con-tractor. Moreover, some confl icts have so deep historical, cultural and political roots that they are seeded by unstructured discernment and cannot be managed by the traditional way (for instance, the resolution of stakeholders' confl icts resulting from construction errors were already a concern in the ancient Hammurabi Code of Laws dated back to about the 18th century bc). The fi rst perception is that a confl ict in construction has negative consequences but it may not be the case. Literature generally distinguishes between functional and dysfunc-tional confl icts. A functional confl ict leads to the improvement of the production process or to a better outcome than would otherwise be expected. On the other hand, a dysfunctional con-fl ict prevents progress, has negative effects in production and conducts to poor outcomes. The former is positive or productive while the latter is destructive and generally leads to dis-putes. Additionally, a functional confl ict may lead to or degenerate into a dysfunctional con-fl ict if inadequately managed. Generally speaking, construction stakeholders aim at preventing disputes because of their possible harsh consequences. Some people will fi ercely try to avoid confl icts because of the fear that confl ict escalation will lead to unpredictable effects or retaliation. But there are also people who may benefi t from disputes in terms of fi nancial advantages, identity, status or power. For those people, a dispute may be viewed as an opportunity to engage diverse opinions and ideas from people holding different perspectives on the confl ict issue. The best way for solving confl icts (either individual or institutional) is transforming them into problems – or preventing them to evolve from these. The fundamental difference between these two concepts is that unlike in confl icts, there is no negative attitude or even hostility between parties involved in problems. In a confl ict, there are antagonistic parties whereas in a problem there is a set of people working together to reach a solution. For prob-lem solving, it is paramount that each individual feels he or she is part of the solution, not part of the problem. The fi rst step for confl ict solving is confl ict analysis, encompassing confl ict types and con-fl ict causes. Although these have broadly been addressed above, root causes for confl icts must be further investigated. Additionally, as with any other social course of action, there is a confl ict process bringing in results and effects. The following sections present the most common types of confl icts between construction stakeholders and explain how they can be effectively managed.},

Through high-risk infant follow-up (HRIF) programs and other early detection methods, these delays and complications can be reduced. However, these interventions require substantial resources and can create extra burden on families. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative design study to understand the needs of these families and their professional caregivers. These results reveal diverse challenges facing parents and clinicians attempting to document, understand, and share infant health data that must be balanced in any pervasive health solution. In particular, parents described struggling with when to collect data, while clinicians reported being more concerned about what and how parents track infant health. Based on these results, we present five design implications for applications for preterm infant care, which we incorporated into the design of Estrellita, a mobile health informatics tool to support caregivers of preterm infants.},

abstract = {Advances in mobile computing offer the potential to change when, where, and how health interventions are delivered. Rather than relying on occasional in-clinic interactions, mobile health (mHealth) interventions may overcome constraints due to limited clinician time, poor patient adherence, and inability to provide meaningful interventions at the most appropriate time. Technological capability, however, does not equate with user acceptance and adoption. How then can we ensure that mobile technologies for behavior change meet the needs of their target audience? In this paper, we argue that overcoming acceptance and adoption barriers requires interdisciplinary collaborations, bringing together not only technologists and health researchers but also human-computer interaction (HCI) experts. We discuss the value of human-computer interaction research to the nascent field of mHealth and demonstrate how research from HCI can offer complementary insights on the creation of mobile health interventions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations in mobile health and suggest ways to overcome them.},

abstract = {Neonatal nurses today are challenged not only to provide the best possible developmental care for a preterm infant but also to help the mother through an uncertain motherhood toward a feeling of being a real mother for her preterm baby. An increasing interest in mothers' experiences of having a preterm baby is seen. A meta-synthesis of 14 qualitative research studies on mothers' experiences of having a preterm baby in the neonatal intensive care unit, published from 2000 onward, was conducted. Noblit and Hare's methodological approach was used. The meta-synthesis revealed five metaphors that captured the mothers' experiences. These metaphors centered on reciprocal relationships that consisted of mother-baby relationship ("from their baby to my baby"), maternal development (a striving to be a real normal mother), the turbulent neonatal environment (from foreground to background), maternal caregiving and role reclaiming strategies (from silent vigilance to advocacy), and mother-nurse relationship (from continuously answering questions through chatting to sharing of knowledge). Implications of the meta-synthesis for neonatal nursing are addressed. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore the development of relationships between parents and nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit. Background. As increasingly smaller premature babies survive, the prolonged hospitalization that follows makes relationships between parents and nurses crucial. A collaborative partnership in which all the family members' needs are acknowledged is suggested as the best approach. Method. A hermeneutic approach was adopted, using overt participant observation (160 hours) and in-depth interviews to study interactions between parents and nurses. The participants were six mothers, six fathers, and six nurses from a 13-bed Norwegian neonatal intensive care unit. Data were obtained over 27 weeks from 2003 until 2004. Findings. A partnership between parents and nurses developed in three phases: the acute critical phase, the stabilizing phase, and the discharge phase. The stabilizing phase seemed the most challenging. As exhausted parents expressed the importance of maintaining the trusting relationship with their primary nurses to become confident when assuming more responsibility and adjusting to the new situation, nurses purposely withdrew and reduced their contact with parents, facilitating their independence and confidence as caretakers. Parents and nurses rarely seemed to discuss with each other the discrepancy in their understanding of the detachment process. Conclusion. Acknowledging the need for parents and nurses to discuss the processes of involvement and detachment may contribute positively to the development of family-centred care in neonatal intensive care units.},

A purposeful sample of 8 mothers was gathered and interviews were conducted over a 4-month period. Each interview was audio recorded and took place in the study participant's home or another place of her choosing. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed independently with themes being identified and organized for each participant. From these analyses, the themes of fear, exhaustion, determination, and thankfulness were identified as being common to all study participants and became the basis for developing the essence of the phenomenon. The essence of this experience for these mothers was their resolve to do whatever was necessary to ensure the best possible outcomes for their infants. The data gathered from these personal interviews will serve to further inform our understanding of this important time from the perspective of those who experienced it, as well as aid in the design of interventions to address the specific needs of these mothers prior to NICU discharge.},

This is not only a shift from work oriented productive activities to leisure and pleasurable engagements; but also a new milieu for production and innovation and entails a reorientation from “democracy at work” to “democratic innovation”. What democratic innovation entails is currently defined by management and innovation research; which claims that innovation has been democratized through easy access to production tools and lead-users as the new experts driving innovation. We sketch an alternative “democratizing innovation” practice more in line with the original visions of participatory design based on our experience of running Malm{\"{o}} Living Labs - an open innovation milieu where new constellations; issues and ideas evolve from bottom-up long-term collaborations amongst diverse stakeholders. Two cases and controversial matters of concern are discussed. The fruitfulness of the concepts “Things” (as opposed to objects); “infrastructuring” (as opposed to projects) and “agonistic public spaces” (as opposed to consensual decision-making) are explored in relation to participatory innovation practices and democracy.},

abstract = {Over the past century, educational psychologists and researchers have posited many theories to explain how individuals learn, i.e. how they acquire, organize and deploy knowledge and skills.The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century andnote that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its na{\"{i}}ve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and as a result of the emergence of computer technologies especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciencesbecame more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview ofthesciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.The Encyclopedia of theSciences of Learningprovides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction, pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the Encyclopedia provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical termsprovides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications.

For this reason, VHA West Coast (a regional division of VHA, Inc., a national network of community-owned hospitals and health care systems) conducted the Nurse-Physician Relationship Survey, targeting nurses, physicians, and executives in a large network of hospitals. VHA designed the survey to assess how these disparate groups viewed nurse-physician relationships, disruptive physician behavior, the institu- tional response to such behavior, and how such behavior affected nurse satisfaction, morale, and retention. An analysis of the first 1,200 responses from nurses, physicians, and hospital executives suggests that daily interactions between nurses and physicians strongly influence nurses' morale. All respondents were very concerned with the significance of nurse-physician relationships and the atmosphere they create. And although all respondents saw a direct link between disruptive physician behavior and nurse satisfaction and retention, the groups differed in their beliefs about responsibility, barri- ers to progress, and potential solutions. The findings suggest that the quality of nurse-physician relationships must be addressed as facilities seek to improve nurse recruitment and retention},

abstract = {There is growing interest in assisted living technologies to support independence at home. Such technologies should ideally be designed ‘in the wild' i.e. taking account of how real people live in real homes and communities. The ATHENE (Assistive Technologies for Healthy Living in Elders: Needs Assessment by Ethnography) project seeks to illuminate the living needs of older people and facilitate the co-production with older people of technologies and services. This paper describes the development of a cultural probe tool produced as part of the ATHENE project and how it was used to support home visit interviews with elders with a range of ethnic and social backgrounds, family circumstances, health conditions and assisted living needs. Thirty one people aged 60 to 98 were visited in their homes on three occasions. Following an initial interview, participants were given a set of cultural probe materials, including a digital camera and the ‘Home and Life Scrapbook' to complete in their own time for one week. Activities within the Home and Life Scrapbook included maps (indicating their relationships to people, places and objects), lists (e.g. likes, dislikes, things they were concerned about, things they were comfortable with), wishes (things they wanted to change or improve), body outline (indicating symptoms or impairments), home plan (room layouts of their homes to indicate spaces and objects used) and a diary. After one week, the researcher and participant reviewed any digital photos taken and the content of the Home and Life Scrapbook as part of the home visit interview. The cultural probe facilitated collection of visual, narrative and material data by older people, and appeared to generate high levels of engagement from some participants. However, others used the probe minimally or not at all for various reasons including limited literacy, physical problems (e.g. holding a pen), lack of time or energy, limited emotional or psychological resources, life events, and acute illness. Discussions between researchers and participants about the materials collected (and sometimes about what had prevented them completing the tasks) helped elicit further information relevant to assisted living technology design. The probe materials were particularly helpful when having conversations with non-English speaking participants through an interpreter. Cultural probe methods can help build a rich picture of the lives and experiences of older people to facilitate the co-production of assisted living technologies.

abstract = {Within the field of neonatal care, two approaches have gained prominence - incubator care and kangaroo mother care. Each contributes to a baby's physiological well-being. The aim of this study was to conduct an investigation into the effects of incubator care and kangaroo mother care from a psychological perspective - specifically an interactional approach - by undertaking interactional pattern analyses of mother-baby pairs receiving incubator care and kangaroo mother care, respectively. Person-centred interviews were conducted and audio recorded with 17 mothers whose babies were receiving either incubator care or kangaroo mother care at the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, South Africa. Each interview was studied by an independent clinical psychologist trained in observation and, in particular, the interactional pattern analysis and who then completed an adapted interactional pattern analysis questionnaire. The procedure yielded standardised interactional pattern analyses for the mother-baby pairs. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that, in relation to their babies, the mothers in the kangaroo mother care group yielded significantly more effective interactional patterns than those in the incubator care group, highlighting that, in terms of the interactional approach, kangaroo mother care may be the preferred method of neonatal care. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2015.},

However, evaluating the effectiveness of the creativity support provided by different technologies and workshop techniques is challenging. This is especially so when evaluation takes place during the workshop and maintaining a creative atmosphere is important. In this paper we briefly outline the development of one simple method of evaluation we have designed whilst studying the use of information visualizations within generative design workshops. Here we discuss how reflective postcards are used to replace questionnaires as a way to collect participants' responses.},

abstract = {Abstract: Even though there is a constant and accelerating growth of the aging population worldwide, such a rapid rise is negatively impacting available home and community services not able to encompass the necessities associated with the increased number of older people. In particular, there are increasing demands on e-health care services and smart technologies needed for frail elders with chronic diseases and also for those experiencing active aging. Advanced Technology Care Innovation for older persons encompasses all sectors (assistive technology, robotics, home automation, and home care- and institution-based healthcare monitoring, telemedicine) dedicated to promoting health and wellbeing in all types of living environments. Considering that there is a large concern and demand by older persons to remain in familiar social living surroundings, study projects joined with industries have been currently initiated, especially across Europe to improve health and wellbeing. This article will highlight the latest updates in Europe and, in particular in Italy, regarding scientific projects dedicated to unraveling how diverse needs can be translated into an up-to-date technology innovation for the growing elder population. We will provide information regarding advanced technology designed for those with specific geriatric-correlated conditions in familiar living settings and for individuals aging actively. This is an important action because numerous emerging developments are based on user needs identified by geriatricians, thus, underlining the indispensable role of geriatric medicine toward future guidelines on specific technology.

@article{Flacking2006,
abstract = {A preterm birth and subsequent hospitalization of an infant at a neonatal unit (NU) implies an extraordinary life situation for mothers, in which the maternal role and breastfeeding begin and evolve in a medical and unfamiliar setting. Descriptions of how women experience "becoming a mother" and breastfeeding in such a situation are sparse and this question was addressed in the present study. In this qualitative study, inspired by the grounded theory approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 mothers whose very preterm infants had been cared for in seven NUs in Sweden. Findings indicated the importance of quality in social bonds with the infant, father, staff and other mothers at the NU, for "becoming mothers" and experiencing mutually satisfying breastfeeding. Three themes comprised a structure for descriptions of experiences, social bonds and mediated emotions: (1) 'loss' of the infant and the emotional chaos - "putting life on hold"; (2) separation - a sign of being unimportant as a person and mother; and (3) critical aspects of becoming more than a physical mother. The qualities were described as trustful or distrustful, characterized by accompanying feelings of pride/trust or shame/distrust. Social bonds were affected not only by the interpersonal interplay but also by the public environment and care routines. In conclusion, the contextual setting and distrustful social bonds impaired the ability to "become mothers" and the sensation of reciprocity i.e. breastfeeding becoming dutiful and not mutually satisfying. As breastfeeding is an intimate interplay and a personal choice it was considered that the best breastfeeding support would seem to be provision of a favorable environment that enhances the mother's confidence in herself. The contextual setting should be modeled such as to create conditions for a trustful and reciprocal mother-infant bond. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In long-term care environments, residents who have severe mobility deficits are typically transported by having another person push the individual in a manual wheelchair. This practice is inefficient and encourages staff to hurry to complete the process, thereby setting the stage for unsafe practices. Furthermore, the time involved in assembling multiple individuals with disabilities often deters their participation in group activities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The Wheelchair Convoy System (WCS) is being developed to allow a single caregiver to move multiple individuals without removing them from their wheelchairs. The WCS will consist of a processor, and a flexible cord linking each wheelchair to the wheelchair in front of it. A Participatory Design approach - in which several iterations of design, fabrication and evaluation are used to elicit feedback from users - was used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An iterative cycle of development and evaluation was followed through five prototypes of the device. The third and fourth prototypes were evaluated in unmanned field trials at J. Iverson Riddle Development Center. The prototypes were used to form a convoy of three wheelchairs that successfully completed a series of navigation tasks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A Participatory Design approach to the project allowed the design of the WCS to quickly evolve towards a viable solution. The design that emerged by the end of the fifth development cycle bore little resemblance to the initial design, but successfully met the project's design criteria. Additional development and testing is planned to further refine the system.},

At the peak of the epidemic, the government, going against consensus scientific opinion, argued that HIV was not the cause of AIDS and that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs were not useful for patients and declined to accept freely donated nevirapine and grants from the Global Fund. Using modeling, we compared the number of persons who received ARVs for treatment and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission between 2000 and 2005 with an alternative of what was reasonably feasible in the country during that period. More than 330,000 lives or approximately 2.2 million person-years were lost because a feasible and timely ARV treatment program was not implemented in South Africa. Thirty-five thousand babies were born with HIV resulting in 1.6 million person-years lost by not implementing a mother-to-child transmission prophylaxis program using nevirapine. The total lost benefits of ARVs are at least 3.8 million person-years for the period 2000-2005.},

abstract = {Research and development for interactive digital health interventions requires multi-disciplinary expertise in identifying user needs, and developing and evaluating each intervention. Two of the central areas of expertise required are Health (broadly defined) and Human–Computer Interaction. Although these share some research methods and values, they traditionally have deep differences that can catch people unawares, and make interdisciplinary collaborations challenging, resulting in sub-optimal project outcomes. The most widely discussed is the contrast between formative evaluation (emphasised in Human–Computer Interaction) and summative evaluation (emphasised in Health research). However, the differences extend well beyond this, from the nature of accepted evidence to the culture of reporting. In this paper, we present and discuss seven lessons that we have learned about the contrasting cultures, values, assumptions and practices of Health and Human–Computer Interaction. The lessons are structured accord...},

abstract = {Living Archives is a research project exploring the roles of archives in a digitised society. Together, with the Malm{\"{o}} City Archives, we initiated a project aiming at prototyping co-archiving practices for young newcomers, to contribute to a newcomers archive. The project emerged as a reaction to the situation in 2015, where 162,877 people sought asylum in Sweden. In response to this situation the Malm{\"{o}} City Archives is organising activities to wel- come and help integrate newcomers. This paper however, doesn't focus on the design proposals prototyped as part of the project, but on ethical challenges when collaborating with vulnerable user groups. Before starting the research process we attended a seminar to discuss our ethical stand. We also revisited the ethical standards in research, as well as papers on ethical considerations in design research. Nevertheless, in encountering the youngsters we realised that we were not adequately prepared. To think about ethical standpoints in theory is one thing, but what happens in situ is something else. In this paper we highlight our personal expe- riences in our first meetings with the user group. We discuss the complexities of establishing collaborations with vulnerable groups, to avoid a na{\"{i}}ve view of what such projects, and collaborations require in terms of time and resources. Given the current refugee situation and the potentials of design actions to tackle major societal problems, it is likely that many design researchers will be engaging with these issues, thus these discussions are required.},

abstract = {Abstract Activity theory -- a conceptual framework originally developed by Aleksei Leontiev -- has its roots in the socio-cultural tradition in Russian psychology. The foundational concept of the theory is human activity, which is understood as purposeful, mediated, and transformative interaction between human beings and the world. Since the early 1990s, activity theory has been a visible landmark in the theoretical landscape of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Along with some other frameworks, such as distributed cognition and phenomenology, it established itself as a leading post-cognitivist approach in HCI and interaction design. In this book we discuss the conceptual foundations of activity theory and its contribution to HCI research. After making the case for theory in HCI and briefly discussing the contribution of activity theory to the field (Chapter One) we introduce the historical roots, main ideas, and principles of activity theory (Chapter Two). After that we present in-depth analyses of three...},

@article{Flacking2007,
abstract = {In mothers of preterm infants, the process of becoming a mother is initiated in a public and medical environment, in which the mothers become dependent on the benevolence and support of the staff. This setting and an experience of insecure social bonds impair the ability to become a mother during the infant's stay at the neonatal unit (NU), and breastfeeding may become a duty and not be mutually satisfying. Studies on how women experience becoming a mother and breastfeeding after the infant's discharge are sparse and this question is addressed in the present grounded theory study. Twenty five mothers, whose very preterm infants had received care in seven NUs in Sweden, were interviewed once, 1-12 months after discharge. We propose a model to increase understanding of the process of becoming a mother and breastfeeding, after the infant's discharge from the NU. The mother's emotional expressions in this process showed pendular swings from feeling emotionally exhausted to feeling relieved, from experiencing an insecure to a secure bond, and from regarding breastfeeding as being non-reciprocal to being reciprocal. Unresolved grief, the institutional authority at the NU and experiences of shame were three of the central barriers to a secure and reciprocal relationship. The pendular changes give us a deeper understanding of the variations in both attachment and attunement. Perhaps the negative extremes are more prominent among these mothers on account of their infant's illness and their NU experiences. If our proposed model is valid, it is vital that these findings are considered by those involved in the short- and long-term care in order to support the mothers to establish a secure bond, comprising both attachment and attunement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Drama-related methods can shed light on the contexts in which a new product will be used, helping to clarify any potential issues users may have with the design. These methods can improve communication and facilitate more fruitful collaboration between the various stakeholders. Improvisation can be used to improve the effectiveness and reliability of brainstorming sessions. However, the level of acting skill required of the participants needs consideration, and must be appropriate to the purpose of the evaluation. Also, drama methods generally add resources to the design process, and there is a lack of validation studies of tangible improvements to the designed product. We provide recommendations for design-drama approaches with the potential to benefit different stages of a product's development.},

Results Seventy-one diabetes apps were randomly selected (from a pool of 552 diabetes apps) and reviewed. The features of most apps failed to include content areas of known importance for managing diabetes in older adults. Usability of all tested applications was rated moderate to good. Conclusions Designing maximally effective medical applications would benefit from attention to both usability and content guidelines targeted for the largest potential user population. Despite the preponderance of older adults in the potential user group, failing to consider the relevance of content, in addition to usability for the specific population will ultimately limit the usefulness of the app.},

Methods A literature search was conducted in the following databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Wiley Online Library and Scopus from year 2002 to 2012, to include papers that reported studies on physician?nurse collaboration in the hospital setting. Findings Seventeen papers were included in this review. Three of the reviewed articles were qualitative studies and the other 14 were quantitative studies. Three key themes emerged from this review: (1) attitudes towards physician?nurse collaboration, where physicians viewed physician?nurse collaboration as less important than nurses but rated the quality of collaboration higher than nurses; (2) factors affecting physician?nurse collaboration, including communication, respect and trust, unequal power, understanding professional roles, and task prioritizing; and (3) improvement strategies for physician?nurse collaboration, involving inter?professional education and interdisciplinary ward rounds. Conclusion This review has highlighted important aspects of physician?nurse collaboration that could be addressed by future research studies. These include: developing a comprehensive instrument to assess collaboration in greater depth; conducting rigorous intervention studies to evaluate the effectiveness of improvement strategies for physician?nurse collaboration; and examining the role of senior physicians and nurses in facilitating collaboration among junior physicians and nurses. Other implications include inter?professional education to empower nurses in making clinical decisions and putting in place policies to resolve workplace issues.},

They conducted three group interviews with International Journal of Qualitative Methods 2007, 6(4) 2 nurses during which they asked about the issues the nurses face(d) in providing nursing care amid enduring social division. Through a discursive analysis of within-group interaction, they demonstrate how participants employ a range of interpretive resources, the effect of which is to prioritize particular knowledge concerning the nature of nursing care. The identification of such patterned activity highlights the ethnographic value of focus groups to reveal social conventions guiding the production of accounts but also suggests that accounts cannot be divorced from the circumstances of their production. Consequently, the authors argue that focus groups should be considered most useful for illuminating locally sanctioned ways of talking about sensitive issues.},

abstract = {This paper presents a structured way to evaluate challenging group or ‘co-design dynamics' in participatory design processes with children. In the form of a critical reflection on a project in which 103 children were involved as design partners, we describe the most prevalent co-design dynamics. For example, some groups rush too quickly towards consensus to safeguard group cohesiveness instead of examining other choice alternatives (i.e., groupthink). Besides ‘groupthink' we describe five more challenging co-design dynamics: ‘laughing out loud', ‘free riding', ‘unequal power', ‘apart together' and ‘destructive conflict'. We argue that balancing these dynamics has a positive impact on the dialectic process of developing values and ideas in participatory design, as well as on children's motivation. Therefore, the CCI community could benefit from our in-depth exploration and categorization of challenging group dynamics when co-designing technology with children.},

abstract = {The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades and although the outcome improved, prematurity is still a large global health issue and is ranked in the top 10 of the WHO list of leading causes of burden of disease (1). Prematurity still leads to organ injury, especially of the lungs and brain, and is responsible for 50{\%} of perinatal mortality (2). Historically, much progress in neonatal care was made through the use of technology. The chances of survival for preterm infants increased by the development of an infant incubator. Later on, preterm infants were able to survive by the use of a mechanical ventilator specifically designed for neonates. However, preterm infants on mechanical ventilation developed classic bronchopulmonary dys-plasia, indicating that exposing fragile patients to technology can also have negative consequences. For this reason, the technology in neonatology is in a continuous process of improvement. Preterm infants are now protected by a double-walled servo-controlled incubator, and more sophisticated mechanical ventilators are used with built-in algorithms guaranteeing that even the smallest tidal volumes can be delivered in a safe manner. Currently, technology combined with computer intelligence can support the caregiver in their daily task. Neonatal caregivers are aware that preterm infants are a very fragile patient population and that they work daily with only narrow ranges of normal and safe values, and injury can easily occur when the infant is outside the margins. Technical devices with built-in algorithms will help caregivers to maintain preterm infants within these ranges. Thus, minimizing the occurrence and duration of injurious moments can be very challenging. There is an ongoing development of techni-cal applications specially designed to solve neonatal problems, some examples are discussed below. StaBiliZinG preterM inFantS While cOrd intact There is now convincing evidence demonstrating that preterm infants are most vulnerable and uniquely susceptible for injury immediately after birth (3). Although neonatal care of preterm infants in the NICU has improved considerably and reduced mortality, improvements during the first 10 min of newborn life (i.e., in the delivery room) lags behind and is considered to be a large risk factor for future complications (3, 4). Not only improper ventilation can lead to lung and cerebral injury, it has become clear that immediate cord clamping, necessary to apply respiratory support as soon as possible, is also responsible for hemodynamic instability (5). Animal experiments have demonstrated that deferring cord clamping until after ventilation onset sustains preload and cardiac output and avoids the large disturbances in systemic and cerebral hemodynamic during transition (6). Efforts are now undertaken to stabilize the preterm infant close to the mother while the cord remains intact. However, it remains challenging to provide adequate respiratory support while there is no stretch or kinking of the, sometimes, very short umbilical cord of the preterm infant (7, 8). Purpose-built resuscitation tables are now developed with a platform that can be placed very close to the birth canal, making it possible to the neonatal caregiver to provide full standard care while the cord remains intact. For a successful change in the approach of preterm infants at birth, the neonatal and obstetric team will need to work together more closely and also need to be trained in the new approach. Although most projects are still in a phase to demonstrate the safety and},

abstract = {Research in human computer interaction (HCI) covers both technological and human behavioural concerns. As a consequence, the contributions made in HCI research tend to be aware to either engineering or the social sciences. In HCI the purpose of practical research contributions is to reveal unknown insights about human behaviour and its relationship to technology. Practical research methods normally used in HCI include formal experiments, field experiments, field studies, interviews, focus groups, surveys, usability tests, case studies, diary studies, ethnography, contextual inquiry, experience sampling, and automated data collection. In this paper, we report on our experience using the evaluation methods focus groups, surveys and interviews and how we adopted these methods to develop artefacts: either interface's design or information and technological systems. Four projects are examples of the different methods application to gather information about user's wants, habits, practices, concerns and preferences. The goal was to build an understanding of the attitudes and satisfaction of the people who might interact with a technological artefact or information system. Conversely, we intended to design for information systems and technological applications, to promote resilience in organisations (a set of routines that allow to recover from obstacles) and user's experiences. Organisations can here also be viewed within a system approach, which means that the system perturbations even failures could be characterized and improved. The term resilience has been applied to everything from the real estate, to the economy, sports, events, business, psychology, and more. In this study, we highlight that resilience is also made up of a number of different skills and abilities (self-awareness, creating meaning from other experiences, self-efficacy, optimism, and building strong relationships) that are a few foundational ingredients, which people should use along with the process of enhancing an organisation's resilience. Resilience enhances knowledge of resources available to people confronting existing problems.},

The objective of this study was to analyse the decision-making capabilities of patients from nurses' perspectives of interprofessional relationships using Foucauldian ethics. This qualitative study was based on poststructuralist Foucault references with in-depth interviews of nurses working in internal medicine and specialties in a general hospital. The patients constantly appeared in the definition of teamwork, but also as a passive element used by every professional to communicate with others. Nurses continue modelling a type of patient passivity, or what Foucault called passive subjectivity in relation to oneself, because the patient is guided and directed to take charge of a truth provided by professionals. Nurses must break the rigid design of sections or professional skills, and adopt a model of teamwork that meets the needs of the patient and increases their decision-making power. The quality of care will increase to the extent that professionals establish a relationship of equality with the patient, allowing the patient to make real decisions about their care. An egalitarian model of teamwork is beneficial to the patient, abandoning the idea of a team where the patient and family are constantly excluded from decisions about their care.},

We argue that such understanding is only visible through detailed analysis of naturally occurring co-design activities. We find that the design trajectory varies in how the participants orient themselves to each other and in relation to the design artefacts. Tensions make visible which communicative resources are sensitive to what the participants interpret as relevant in the context of their institutional norms and values.

Through collaborative creative processes, co-design provides useful insight and direction for the design of these technologies from populations such as older adults who are often neglected in design. Additionally, extensive technology experience prior to co-design may elicit richer feedback from users that may otherwise be unfamiliar with the intervention of interest. In this paper, we examine the value of experience-based co-design among older adults. We report on seven design sessions conducted with a total of 25 older adults, following a 10-week study of fitness app effectiveness. Sessions were grouped into users and non-users of the assigned app following the study. We found that continued use with the assigned application led to more robust, detailed feedback in design sessions, suggesting that long-term, prior use of sample technologies is an important prerequisite to ideating useful features for new health technology. We draw on these findings to make design recommendations, and discuss the values and guidelines of implementing experience-based co-design. 1},

The relation between HAI rates and NICU teamwork climate was assessed using logistic regression models including NICU as a random effect.Results Across NICUs, 36 to 100{\%} (mean 66{\%}) of respondents reported good teamwork. HAI rates were significantly and independently associated with teamwork climate (odds ratio, 0.82; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.73–0.92, p = 0.005), such that the odds of an infant contracting a HAI decreased by 18{\%} with each 10{\%} rise in NICU respondents reporting good teamwork.Conclusion Improving teamwork may be an important element in infection control efforts.},

Across the past twenty years the use of ICT has fundamentally changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of endeavour within business and governance. Education is a very socially oriented activity and quality education has traditionally been associated with strong teachers having high degrees of personal contact with learners. The use of ICT in education lends itself to more student-centred learning settings. But with the world moving rapidly into digital media and information, the role of ICT in education is becoming more and more important and this importance will continue to grow and develop in the 21st century.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ongoing care for chronic conditions such as diabetes is best provided by a range of health professionals working together. There are challenges in achieving this where collaboration crosses organisational and sector boundaries. The aim of this article is to explore the influence of power dynamics and trust on collaboration between health professionals involved in the management of diabetes and their impact on patient experiences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A qualitative case study conducted in a rural city in Australia. Forty five health service providers from nineteen organisations (including fee-for-service practices and block funded public sector services) and eight patients from two services were purposively recruited. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews that were audio-taped and transcribed. A thematic analysis approach was used using a two-level coding scheme and cross-case comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Three themes emerged in relation to power dynamics between health professionals: their use of power to protect their autonomy, power dynamics between private and public sector providers, and reducing their dependency on other health professionals to maintain their power. Despite the intention of government policies to support more shared decision-making, there is little evidence that this is happening. The major trust themes related to role perceptions, demonstrated competence, and the importance of good communication for the development of trust over time. The interaction between trust and role perceptions went beyond understanding each other's roles and professional identity. The level of trust related to the acceptance of each other's roles. The delivery of primary and community-based health services that crosses organisational boundaries adds a layer of complexity to interprofessional relationships. The roles of and role boundaries between and within professional groups and services are changing. The uncertainty and vulnerability associated with these changes has affected the level of trust and mistrust.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Collaboration across organisational boundaries remains challenging. Power dynamics and trust affect the strategic choices made by each health professional about whether to collaborate, with whom, and to what level. These decisions directly influenced patient experiences. Unlike the difficulties in shifting the balance of power in interprofessional relationships, trust and respect can be fostered through a mix of interventions aimed at building personal relationships and establishing agreed rules that govern collaborative care and that are perceived as fair.},

abstract = {Patient empowerment, a concept focused on patient-centeredness and patients autonomy, is a well-discussed topic in health literature. However, translating theory into practice is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interventions on patient empowerment and to identify and compare the modalities of these interventions. For this systematic review including meta-analysis, eligibility criteria were as follows: (i) adult participants with one or more chronic somatic diseases, (ii) "patient empowerment" was explicitly measured (i.e., outcome or measuring instrument), (iii) randomized controlled designs, and (iv) written in English, French, Dutch, or German. A systematic search strategy was applied in five online databases (last search: March 29, 2017). Thirty-two studies were included in this review, of which 23 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Overall effect estimate was significant in favor of the intervention; however, heterogeneity was high. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effect estimate was higher in studies with interventions that comprised individual sessions. The most recurrent behavioral change technique identified in our review was "knowledge", though this is not sufficient to empower. "Goal setting" and "action planning" were more likely to be applied in successful interventions. "Knowledge" could be combined with "goal setting" and "action planning" to empower. Thorough understanding of the concept of patient empowerment remains necessary. Future research should focus on somatic chronic diseases other than diabetes, a consensus definition for patient empowerment, and clinimetric properties of instruments.},

Objectives:To describe the experience of a low-income population during the transition from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home and to compare these experiences with pediatrician perspectives.Study Design:A prospective cohort study in a Level III, 40-bed NICU at a county hospital in Northern California affiliated with seven outpatient pediatric clinics. We surveyed parents in English or Spanish at discharge (n=79) and two weeks after discharge (n=49), along with outpatient pediatricians (n=17). Parents assessed experiences with discharge and the frequency with which barriers were encountered after discharge. We compared parent experiences with pediatrician estimates on four of these barriers.Result:Spanish survey participants had more difficulty finding a NICU doctor (P=0.05) or nurse (P=0.001) to answer their questions. After discharge, 16{\%} of families experienced significant challenges with two or more barriers. In contrast, the majority of pediatricians estimated that 50{\%} or more families had significant challenges with all four barriers.Conclusion:Communication difficulties were the most commonly reported barriers during the NICU stay and physicians overestimated the frequency that families experienced challenges after discharge. Parent input is important to create effective interventions aimed at improving care and limiting disparities.},

The data were collected using 8 deep semi-structured interviews and 3 observations. Then, they were analyzed through inductive content analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Data analysis resulted in identification of 3 main categories and 7 subcategories. The first category was organizational factors with 2 subcategories of educational domain (inadequate education, lack of a system for nursing student selection, and poor professionalization) and clinical domain (difficult working conditions, lack of an efficient system for ongoing education and evaluation, and authoritarian management). The second category was familial factors with socio-cultural, psychological, and economic subcategories. The last category was the factors related to nurses with socio-cultural and psycho-physical subcategories.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Identification of the obstacles against nurse-family communication helps managers of healthcare systems to plan and eliminate the challenges of effective communication.

Structured as an exchange between two researchers who used different approaches in their studies with childhood sexual abuse survivors, in this article, we seek to advance understanding of methodological and ethical issues in designing sensitive research. The first perspective, which is termed protective, promotes the gradual progression of participants from a treatment phase into a research phase, with the ongoing presence of a researcher and a social worker in both phases. In the second perspective, which is termed minimalist, we argue for clear boundaries between research and treatment processes, limiting the responsibility of researchers to ensuring that professional support is available to participants who experience emotional difficulties.

abstract = {The psycho-relational problems in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) are complex and multifaceted and have only recently been properly addressed. Some specific factors make communication in NICU particularly problematic; the baby's clinical condition, the emotional and working conditions of the medical staff, the emotional state of the parents and the setting of the NICU and the interaction of multiple professional figures with the parents. The purpose of communication in NICUs is not only to inform parents of their child's clinical condition; the medical and nursing staff must also educate and guide parents so that they can actively participate in caring for their child and become true "partners" with the medical team in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the staff must also use their communication skills to understand and contain the anxieties and emotions of parents, supporting and comforting them through the most critical moments of their child's illness and possibly even bereavement. Given the number and complexity of the interpersonal exchanges that take place in the NICU, the risk of misunderstanding, misinterpretation and conflict is high. One could say that the interpersonal aspect is an area where the risk of iatrogenesis is elevated. It is recognized that poor staff-family interactions not only reflect negatively on the baby's care and are a source of distress and discontent for the parents, but are also a major cause of medico-legal litigation and increase the incidence of "burnout". Therefore, specific training of the staff in communication is essential if the optimal results, obtained through modern technology, are not to be invalidated.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of our six month design-oriented qualitative study into practices, self-concepts, and information needs among lower-income pregnant women in Pennsylvania. We examined the feasibility and appropriateness of using mobile phone technology as a method for early-pregnancy health education and behavior self-monitoring. Based on our study data, we present a series of considerations unique to the nine-month period of pregnancy that need to be accounted for in mobile health design. Specifically, we: (1) identify challenges in the use of diet, weight, and activity tracking application design paradigms that are specific to the pregnancy experience; (2) introduce a structuring concept we call the pregnancy ecology, which accounts for the information, physical and emotional self-care, and social support needs of pregnant women. This concept allows for a paradigm shift away from activity, diet, and weight tracking applications; and finally, we (3) provide design considerations for mobile health applications geared toward the needs of pregnant women},

This can lead to the unwitting exclusion of people with communication impairments from the design of technologies that have the potential to transform their lives. This paper reports our research into codesign techniques for people whose communication skills are impaired. A variety of techniques were explored on two projects; some were adaptations of existing codesign techniques, others were created specially. In both cases, the emphasis was on creating tangible design languages. The results illustrate how people with communication impairments can be given a voice in design and demonstrate the benefits of doing so.},

abstract = {Research and development for interactive digital health interventions requires multi-disciplinary expertise in identifying user needs, and developing and evaluating each intervention. Two of the central areas of expertise required are Health (broadly defined) and Human–Computer Interaction. Although these share some research methods and values, they traditionally have deep differences that can catch people unawares, and make interdisciplinary collaborations challenging, resulting in sub-optimal project outcomes. The most widely discussed is the contrast between formative evaluation (emphasised in Human–Computer Interaction) and summative evaluation (emphasised in Health research). However, the differences extend well beyond this, from the nature of accepted evidence to the culture of reporting. In this paper, we present and discuss seven lessons that we have learned about the contrasting cultures, values, assumptions and practices of Health and Human–Computer Interaction. The lessons are structured accord...},

@article{Molina2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Interprofessional relationships may impact the decision making of patients in a clinical setting. The objective of this study was to analyse the decision-making capabilities of patients from nurses' perspectives of interprofessional relationships using Foucauldian ethics. This qualitative study was based on poststructuralist Foucault references with in-depth interviews of nurses working in internal medicine and specialties in a general hospital. The patients constantly appeared in the definition of teamwork, but also as a passive element used by every professional to communicate with others. Nurses continue modelling a type of patient passivity, or what Foucault called passive subjectivity in relation to oneself, because the patient is guided and directed to take charge of a truth provided by professionals. Nurses must break the rigid design of sections or professional skills, and adopt a model of teamwork that meets the needs of the patient and increases their decision-making power. The quality of care will increase to the extent that professionals establish a relationship of equality with the patient, allowing the patient to make real decisions about their care. An egalitarian model of teamwork is beneficial to the patient, abandoning the idea of a team where the patient and family are constantly excluded from decisions about their care.},

Dialogic design is a radically democratic design perspective and set of methods for engaging mixed stakeholders in design and consensus action for complex sociotechnical problems shared in common. Based on a systems thinking methodology developed from principles of communicative action, dialogic design facilitates diverse groups in disentangling core issues from complex, interconnected problem areas and leads to genuine consensus for action. The SDD method deploys a mix of dialogue types with computer-assisted information displays to generate and maintain a shared common ground throughout dialogue.},

@techreport{Somerville2007,
abstract = {The first years of the new millennium have seen dramatic changes in how information is produced, as well as how it is organized and accessed. Within the increasingly digital environment, technology continues to transform how we encounter and experience information. For example, individuals can now produce and share their own information, rather than waiting for book or journal publishers to create and deliver the material-a concept known as peer production. Internet-based social networking sites offer yet another popular way to create and exchange unmediated information. Because these new technology tools enable easy information production and consumption, individuals increasingly circumvent what has traditionally been the role of libraries-organizing, managing, and enabling access. These circumstances challenge libraries' traditional role as repositories of human culture, forcing libraries to evolve. The dynamically changing information landscape prompted faculty researchers from four institutions on three continents to develop a collaborative approach for co-designing libraries of the future. The methodology evolved out of projects involving students in working alongside academic librarians and other campus stakeholders to co-create digital learning objects and digital learning environments. Highly participatory in nature, the design processes benefited from the knowledge of students raised in the United States, Sweden, and Australia, who have grown up with the digital technologies developed in the last decades of the 20 th century and now widely available in the new millennium. These students have spent their entire lives using computers, video games, digital music players, video cameras, mobile phones, email, instant messaging, and other technology tools and toys. As a result, these 'digital natives' think and act differently than the people for whom today's libraries were designed.},

@article{Bayley2008,
abstract = {For many societal decisions, governments and public bodies are beginning to involve stakeholders and the general public to a far greater extent than previously in the decision process. Stakeholder workshops, citizen juries, focus groups, electronic forums, web-polling and many other means of consultation are being used to draw citizens into the process of deciding between different options on the management of their communities. Politicians are drawn to such instruments because greater public involvement seems to achieve greater acceptance of the ultimate decision and, arguably in more objective terms, a better decision. Many academic studies have investigated participation and wider aspects of deliberative democracy and found that the politicians' intuition is borne out in practice. However, while there have been many studies focused on specific instruments of participation, few have compared different ones. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of advice on how to assemble a set of different instruments into a complete participatory decision making process. This paper offers a decision modelling framework which, firstly, provides a methodology which may be used to design participatory processes and, secondly, raises a number of questions which future comparative studies will need to address.},

abstract = {BackgroundAn infant¿s admission to a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) inevitably causes the parents emotional stress. Communication between parents and NICU staff is an essential part of the support offered to the parents and can reduce their emotional stress. The aim of this study was to describe parents¿ experiences of communication with NICU staff.MethodsA hermeneutic lifeworld interview study was performed with 18 families whose children were treated in the level III NICU at a university hospital in Sweden. The interviews were analysed to gain an interpretation of the phenomenon of how parents in the NICU experienced their communication with the staff, in order to find new ways to understand their experience.ResultsParents¿ experience of communication with the staff during their infant¿s stay at the NICU can be described by the main theme `being given attention or ignored in their emotional situation¿. The main theme derives from three themes; (1) meeting a fellow human being, (2) being included or excluded as a parent and (3) bearing unwanted responsibility.ConclusionsThis study shows that parents experienced communication with the NICU staff as essential to their management of their situation. Attentive communication gives the parents relief in their trying circumstances. In contrast, lack of communication contributes to feelings of loneliness, abandonment and unwanted responsibility, which adds to the burden of an already difficult situation. The level of communication in meetings with staff can have a decisive influence on parents¿ experiences of the NICU.The staff should thus be reminded of their unique position to help parents handle their emotional difficulties. The organization should facilitate opportunities for good communication between parents and staff through training, staffing and the physical health care environment.},
